# Up-front Controls (UFC)

The upfront controls (UFC) include the Integrated Control Panel (ICP) and the Data Entry Display (DED). These
provide for quick access of either navigation control, radio frequencies and channels and fire control system
modes and data. Most of your time will be spent using the ICP to control these functions but less frequently
used functions, such as power and audio volume, are located on console panels.

Data accessed through the ICP is displayed on the DED.

![](img/img-57-1-screen.jpg)

The upfront controls are available during normal operations when the C&I knob (IFF Control Panel) is set to the
UFC position. This provides for control of communications, navigation, and IFF primarily via upfront controls. In
the event of failure of the upfront controls, the BACKUP position provides for alternate operation of the radios
and IFF, using their cockpit panels.

- IFF selects the IFF page
- LIST displays a list of less frequently used pages that may be selected by pressing the corresponding
number on the keyboard

**Priority Function Buttons**. Pressing one of the nine labeled buttons on the keypad selects the associated
page for that frequently used function. The keyboard may then be used to enter or change data.

**Data Control Switch (DCS)**. This switch is used to move the asterisk on DED pages, sequence through
different data fields, toggle wind data on the CNI page, and return to the CNI page from other pages.

**DED Increment/Decrement Switch**. This switch increases or decreases values for the field selected on the
current DED page. Values that can be increased or decreased are identified by an up and down arrow next to
them on the display. The DCS is used to cycle between available fields.

**Mode Select (M-SEL) Button**. This button is used on some pages to cycle through available modes.

**Enter (ENTR) Button**. Press this to enter the numbers typed into a field with the keyboard.

**Recall (RCL) Button**. Press this button once to erase the last digit that was entered, e.g., backspace key.

steerpoint, and range is decreasing.

To toggle the auto-step option, use the DCS to position the cursor over the MAN/AUTO field, and press 0 (M-
SEL) to cycle between MAN and AUTO.

Auto-step sequencing will not advance past steerpoint 20.

**Steerpoint Number**. The current steerpoint is displayed. Steerpoints may be selected using the
Increment/Decrement switch or by typing in the desired steerpoint number with this field highlighted.

**Latitude**. The latitude of the selected steerpoint. New coordinates may be entered using the keypad when this
field is highlighted.

**Longitude**. The longitude of the selected steerpoint. New coordinates may be entered using the keypad when
this field is highlighted.

**Elevation**. The elevation in feet of the selected steerpoint. A new elevation may be entered using the keypad
when this field is highlighted.

**Time over Steerpoint**. If applicable, the desired time over steerpoint / time on target may be entered into this
field.


## MGRS Coordinate Display

The DED can display Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) coordinates for steerpoints 21 through 25. The
MGRS coordinate system is an alternative to latitude and longitude used by many military systems.

To display MGRS coordinates, first select a steerpoint between 21 and 25 from the STPT page, that press DCS
Right (SEQ). After a three-second delay, the MGRS coordinates will be shown:

![](img/img-063-148.jpg)

a new system time, position the DCS switch up or down until the asterisks are next to the system time field.

Enter the time using the ICP keypad and press the ENTR pushbutton.

**Hack Time**. This allows for an additional time reference independent of system time. Examples of its use
include setting a backup time reference for local, or some other pre-arranged time or using it as a stopwatch for
low level navigation.

To enter a new time, position the DCS switch up or down until the asterisks are next to the hack time field. Enter
the time using the ICP keypad and press the ENTR pushbutton. The new hack time will be displayed here and
on the CNI page.

Pressing the INC/DEC switch up to INC starts the timer. Pressing it again stops the timer.

Pressing the INC/DEC switch down to DEC resets the timer to zero.

**Delta Time over Steerpoint (TOS)**. This allows you to update the Time over Steerpoint for all steerpoints from
one place. This could be useful if, for example, the planned time on target for all aircraft in a strike package
changes. TOS may be updated by entering a delta TOS value on the DED. The entered time will be added to or
subtracted from all TOS values. Enterable values range from -23:59:59 to 23:59:59.

**Date**. A new date may be entered here using the MM/DD/YY format.
