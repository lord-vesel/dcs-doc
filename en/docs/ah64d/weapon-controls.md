# Weapon Hand Controls

Either crewmember may employ any aircraft weapon system independently of the other crewstation. However,
only the Copilot/Gunner can use the TADS to provide laser guidance for the AGM-114K Hellfire missile.



## Cyclic & Collective Controls

The Pilot and Copilot/Gunner Cyclic and Collective Mission Grips include identical controls for weapons
employment. However, the CPG’s cyclic weapon trigger is only activated if the CPG actions a weapon using the
Weapon Action Switch on the cyclic.
