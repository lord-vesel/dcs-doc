APPENDIX B – ASE THREAT SYMBOLS
The Tactical Situation Display (TSD) and Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) pages provide the crew with
warning indications of radar and laser threats in azimuth, accompanied by audio alerts.
The threat symbols under the “ASE” column correspond with how the radar or laser threat will appear on the
Tactical Situation Display (TSD) and Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) pages.
The quoted words or phrases under the “AUDIO” column correspond with the associated audio alert that will be
heard over the ICS when the radar or laser threat is detected.
Air defense radar systems are further identified by their type in small font under the “RADAR SYSTEMS” column.
The table below lists the definition of each type abbreviation following the radar system’s designation/name to
identify the radar’s function within their respective air defense units.

APPENDIX C – ABR PAGE POINT TABLES
The Abbreviation (ABR) sub-page provides the crew a library of aircraft point symbols that can be added to the
TSD for the purposes of navigation, increasing situational awareness, or as a method of cueing sensors. This
page can be accessed via the TSD Point or TSD Utility sub-pages and can provide a quick look-up of required
IDENT codes for inputting new points.
In the tables below, icons with “AAA” associated with the point symbol will display the three-character free text
of that point directly on the TSD itself; whereas other points will only display the point’s index within the database.

APPENDIX D – FREQUENTLY ASKED
QUESTIONS (FAQ)
What version of the AH-64D does the DCS: AH-64D simulate?
DCS: AH-64D simulates an AH-64D Block 2 in service with the United States Army between the years of 2005-
2010, with a specific equipment configuration that was common (but not exclusive) within that time period. The
specific avionics version that is being modeled is Lot 9.1, which was fielded to U.S. Army AH-64D Block 2 aircraft
in 2005, along with additional equipment that was fielded to the U.S Army fleet between 2005 and 2007.


What is the difference between an AH-64D equipped with a mast-mounted Fire Control
Radar and an AH-64D without the FCR?
There is very little difference between these aircraft configurations. The presence (or absence) of the FCR mast-
mounted assembly does not denote a different model of AH-64 but is simply a removeable sensor system (much
like a targeting pod on a strike fighter). When the FCR system is removed, the aircraft will still perform and
operate the same, albeit with less overall gross weight and more limited sensor/targeting options to the crew.
Further, while the U.S. Army has operated AH-64D's with a mixed fleet of FCR and non-FCR aircraft, some
countries have operated exclusively FCR-equipped AH-64D variants (such as the United Kingdom's Army Air
Corps), or exclusively non-FCR-equipped variants (such as the Royal Netherlands Air Force).


What is the difference between the Pilot Night Vision System (PNVS) and the Target
Acquisition Designation Sight (TADS)?
The PNVS is a FLIR-only steerable turret that is designed to aid the Pilot in the back seat while flying in total
darkness. The TADS is a multi-sensor steerable turret that allows the Copilot/Gunner in the front seat to target
and designate enemy locations and vehicles for the aircraft’s weapon systems. The TADS can also be used to fly
in total darkness and serves as a backup to the PNVS in this regard. Either crewmember can select either the
PNVS or the TADS FLIR sensors for flying, but neither sensor can be used by both crewmembers at the same
time.
(See Night Vision Systems for more information.)


Can the PNVS be used to aim weapons?
The PNVS is simply a Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor that provides a video underlay to the crewmember
using it for flying at night; it is not a sight and it does not perform targeting nor aim any weapon systems. In
such an instance where the Pilot is using the PNVS, the Pilot can be sight-selected to HMD while using the PNVS,
and the HMD does aim weapon systems while the PNVS provides video imagery of the surroundings.


Can the TADS be used by the Pilot in the backseat?
The TADS can be used in one of two ways: as a sight for targeting or as a sensor for flying. In the case of the
former, only the Copilot/Gunner in the front seat can directly control the TADS for the purposes of targeting and
aiming of weapon systems. In the case of the latter, the TADS FLIR can also be used as a night-flying sensor
using the NVS Sensor Select switch on the Collective Flight Grip. Because of this, either crewmember can select
the TADS as their NVS sensor, but only the Copilot/Gunner can select the TADS as their sight for targeting.
(See Night Vision Systems for more information.)
What is the difference between the Pilot Night Vision System (PNVS) and night vision
goggles?
The PNVS is a steerable Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) turret that follows the helmet movements of the Pilot
and transmits a thermal-based video of the environment to the Pilot's Helmet Display Unit (HDU). This system
displays the thermal environment through various shades of brightness to distinguish varying levels of heat
emissions from objects within the FLIR's field of view. Night vision goggles on the other hand amplify light sources
and reflected light from the environment to allow a human eye to distinguish detail and contrast.


Why can I see IR pointers when using night vision goggles, but I cannot see them when
using the TADS or PNVS?
Typical night vision goggles (such as the AN/AVS-6 goggles simulated in the DCS: AH-64D) amplify visible and
near-infrared light to a level that can be used by the human eye to distinguish detail and contrast. Because of
this, devices that transmit light in the near-infrared spectrum (such as IR beacons or IR pointers) can be seen by
individuals wearing NVG's; whereas some FLIR systems that operate on different portions of the IR spectrum,
such as the AH-64D PNVS and TADS turrets, cannot.


Why can’t night vision goggles be used at the same time as the Helmet Display Unit
(HDU)?
The HDU itself physically interferes with the proper wear of the AN/AVS-6 night-vision goggles. However, more
importantly, the use of NVG’s and the HDU simultaneously can often present circumstances where the two devices
are not properly aligned and can incur aiming errors when employing the helicopter sensors or weapon systems.
For this reason, use of the two devices in such a manner is a prohibited practice for U.S. Army crewmembers.


Is an IR pointer and a laser designator the same?
No, an IR pointer is a tightly focused beam of light that continuously emits in the near-infrared spectrum, whereas
a laser designator employs a coded pulse of laser energy that can be detected by compatible sensors or weapon
systems that are scanning for that precise laser pulse sequence.


Why does the horizon line in the IHADSS symbology not coincide with the real horizon?
The IHADSS allows the crewmembers to maintain situational awareness of the majority of the AH-64D's flight
state, sensors, and weapon systems, regardless of where the crewmember is looking at any given time. Either
crewmember can look independently of the helicopter's flight path or nose direction without losing key pieces of
data necessary to fly and fight. This allows the Pilot on the controls to be looking back over his/her shoulder
while in a steep pitch-back turn and still have full awareness of the aircraft's attitude and flight state; or be
scanning out to either side for threats or obstacles while flying slowly at nap-of-the-earth altitudes just feet over
the treetops.
When viewing the horizon line (and/or pitch ladder in Cruise mode), the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) Reticle – or central
crosshairs – within the symbology represents the nose of the aircraft, much like the watermark on a cockpit
attitude indicator. If the artificial horizon line bisects the LOS reticle, the helicopter's pitch attitude is level with
the horizon.
(See Symbology Elements for more information.)
Why is the AH-64D’s gun called the Area Weapon System?
The AWS was designed primarily as a close-in defensive weapon system when directed by a crewmember’s
helmet sight to provide suppression against immediate threats to the aircraft or the team. However, the AWS can
also be effectively used as an offensive weapon against light armor, soft-skinned vehicles, or personnel; especially
when directed by the TADS as the sight.


Why does my range source keep switching to a Manual range when I action the gun?
As described above, the gun is designed to be used as a close-in defensive weapon system when employed by
the aircrew’s helmet sights. As such, when a crewmember’s selected sight is HMD (Helmet Mounted Display), the
range source will automatically revert to the Manual range (as set on the WPN page) whenever that crewmember
actions the gun. This prevents an un-intended ranging value from being used when hasty, close-in fires are
needed. As an example, if the crewmember had a Nav range to a target 4 kilometers away, the gun would
attempt to elevate for a ballistic solution of 4,000 meters, and the rounds would impact a location much further
than anticipated. For this reason, it is wise to set a Manual range value on the WPN page that you are proficient
with in engaging targets at close range.
However, this does not prevent the crewmember from setting a different range source such as an Automatic or
Navigation range after the gun is actioned.


Why does the Rocket Steering Cursor not behave as a conventional Continuously
Computed Impact Point (CCIP) reticle?
The Aerial Rocket Sub-system on the AH-64D was designed to be employed as "aerial rocket artillery", making a
team of AH-64D's akin to a hovering MLRS battery. Because unguided rockets can only be employed using ballistic
trajectories (like bullets), the accuracy of the weapon is heavily determined by what sighting method is used to
generate a targeting solution. With CCIP targeting methods, the target must not only be visible to the naked eye,
but any adjustments made to the aimpoint must also be precise enough and distinguishable to the crew in order
for such corrections to unguided munition trajectories to be effective. At longer ranges, the very thickness of any
symbology elements of a CCIP reticle itself on a HUD or helmet display may be the difference of several hundred
meters. For this reason, CCIP reticles are only effective at relatively close ranges, and within visual range of the
naked eye.
In order to engage ground targets with unguided rockets beyond normal visual ranges on the battlefield, and
with such aimpoint accuracy that can be distinguishable at such ranges, the Rocket Steering Cursor is employed
to enable the crew in aligning the helicopter with the required targeting solution for rocket delivery. While used
in Cooperative mode, a secondary advantage to the Rocket Steering Cursor is that the Pilot can use the symbology
to align the helicopter with the required targeting solution provided by the Copilot/Gunner while the Pilot
continues to scan the surrounding terrain for immediate threats, without ever looking in the direction the aircraft
nose is pointed for rocket delivery. Further, since the TADS itself can be slaved to a set of three-dimensional
coordinates, the Rocket Steering Cursor allows the crew to deliver rockets to an area target from behind cover
without having a direct line-of-sight (LOS) to the target.


Why doesn’t the DCS: AH-64D have Stinger or Sidewinder air-to-air missiles?
The DCS: AH-64D is simulating a U.S. Army AH-64D. U.S. Army AH-64’s have never been equipped or capable of
firing Stinger or Sidewinder missiles, despite a small number of weapons tests conducted with such missiles.
There are several “growth” provisions within the AH-64D cockpit controls (such as an Air-To-Air weapon select
position and a missile Cage button) to support future additions of such capability to the AH-64D, however the
avionics of AH-64D’s in U.S. Army service have never supported such weapon systems.
What is a “sight” and how do I determine which one I should use in a tactical situation?
There are three possible “sights” that can be selected to directly aim a weapon or generate a targeting solution
in the AH-64D. These selections are the Helmet-Mounted Display (HMD), the Target Acquisition Designation Sight
(TADS), or the optionally-mounted Fire Control Radar (FCR). Any of these three sight selections can be used by
the Copilot/Gunner, but only HMD and FCR are available to the Pilot. The sight currently selected by the
crewmember will be displayed in the bottom-left corner of the IHADSS symbology.
Each sight used by the AH-64D has both advantages and disadvantages that must be known and evaluated for
any given tactical situation. For example, the TADS is very useful for long-range target identification and
designation for Hellfire missiles, however it may not be the quickest method for engaging a target that is at close-
range. On the other hand, the HMD is very useful for rapidly engaging targets at close-range simply by using the
crewmember’s helmet-tracking capabilities, but the HMD is less accurate than the TADS and cannot designate
targets for missile engagement.
(See Sights and Sensors for more information.)


What is an “acquisition source” or “ACQ” and how do I determine which one I should use
in a tactical situation?
An acquisition source can quickly orient a crewmember’s selected sight to either a point in space relative to the
aircraft nose or a set of three-dimensional coordinates on the battlefield. The purpose of the acquisition source
is to reduce the time needed to manually search and acquire a target with any given sight. In the case of the
TADS or FCR, these sights will physically slew to the location of the selected acquisition source. In the case of
the HMD, the crewmember will receive cueing indications in their helmet symbology of where they should look
to point their head toward the selected acquisition source (in lieu of a robotic arm physically grabbing their head
and forcibly turning it in the correct direction).
As is the case with sight selections, choosing the best acquisition source in any given situation is key to reducing
the time it takes to search, acquire, and engage enemy targets.
(See Acquisition Sources for more information.)


How do I enter a set of MGRS coordinates if a JTAC or other ground unit gives me MGRS
in 4-, 6- or 10-digit formats?
The AH-64D will only accept MGRS coordinates in an 8-digit format. If coordinates are entered using a 4-, 6- or
10-digit MGRS format, the Keyboard Unit (KU) will not accept this entry and the KU display will simply flash to
indicate an invalid data entry. If given a 4-digit or 6-digit MGRS location, simply append zeros to the easting and
northing to achieve the number of required digits, such as 12001200 when given “1212” or 12301230 when given
“123123”. Conversely, when given a 10-digit MGRS coordinate, simply remove the 5th digit from both the easting
and northing to achieve the required 8-digit format, such as 12341234 when given “1234512345”
