# RADAR & LASER SIGNAL DETECTING SETS


The AN/APR-39A(V)4 provides detection of threat radar emissions by using a series of external antennas to
passively detect and identify radar signals. The AN/AVR-2A provides detection of threat laser emissions by using
a series of external detectors to passively detect and classify laser sources. As the combined RLWR system, the
APR-39 and AVR-2 provide threat indications to the aircrew by displaying threat symbols on the TSD and ASE
pages. In addition, the RLWR generates audio voice warnings describing the type of threat, threat direction, and
what mode the radar or laser is operating, allowing the crew to remain focused outside for obstructions to flight
or searching for enemy targets.

Like the TSD, the ASE page provides a singular footprint for the combined indications of the RLWR and RFI (if
equipped with an FCR mast-mounted assembly). The display is an azimuth-only top-down display, with RLWR
threat symbols displayed within the inside of the ASE footprint. The nature of the threat is indicated by the type
of symbol and label, and the severity of the threat is indicated by enhancements placed around the symbol itself.
