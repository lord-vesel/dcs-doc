# Aircraft Start

The AH-64 was designed to be operated from a “field environment” away from established ground support
infrastructure or airfield facilities. Although it is equipped with external power and pneumatic air receptacles,
allowing it to be supported by Aviation Ground Power Units (AGPU) or other ground support equipment, the
primary method of starting the aircraft is via its integrated GTCP36-155 Auxiliary Power Unit (the same gas
turbine engine that powers the AGPU).

Once the APU is up to operating speed, the APU drive shaft mechanically engages the main transmission’s
accessory gearbox, which in turn powers the primary and utility hydraulic pumps and both AC generators. This
pressurizes the flight control servo-actuators and enables AC electrical power to be delivered to some aircraft
systems, including both Transformer Rectifier Units (TRU) which converts AC power to DC power. Once DC power
is supplied to the remainder of the electrical busses, all aircraft systems may be configured as necessary, and the
aircraft battery will be charged.



## Prior to Starting APU

After an external preflight inspection and walk-around has been performed by the aircrew to ensure the aircraft
is flightworthy and all gear and equipment is properly secured within the storage bays, the aircrew enters their
respective crewstations. The seat harness restraints are secured and the crewmembers secure intercom cables
and electrical connectors that supply power to the IHU helmet-tracking sensors.
If not already performed during the preflight inspection, the aircrew inspects their crewstation to ensure all
switches and knobs are set appropriately prior to enabling electrical power and starting the APU.

## APU Start

When the APU button is pressed, a nitrogen pre-charge will force hydraulic fluid from the accumulator cylinder
to discharge through the APU starter, allowing the APU compressor to spool up to sufficient speed for combustion.

Once the APU has reached a sufficient speed for the gas generator to become self-sustaining, the APU starter
will disengage.

The APU start sequence is fully automatic and requires no additional action by the crew.

1.     [[**PLT**]]   APU button – Press and release to initiate APU start sequence.

2.     [[**PLT**]]   EUFD advisory column – Verify “APU ON” message is displayed.

3.     [[**PLT**]]   MSTR IGN switch – BATT (if external power was used prior to APU start).



### After Starting APU

Once the APU has been started and the MPDs have initialized, perform the following:

1.    [[**PLT & CPG**]]   Canopy door – Close.
2.    [[**PLT / CPG**]]   DTU page – Select MASTER LOAD to upload DTC data to the aircraft systems. (N/I)
3.    [[**PLT & CPG**]]   Aircraft systems – Initialize and configure remaining options as appropriate for mission.



### Initialize Aircraft Systems

After a Master Load has been completed on the DTU page, remaining options within each cockpit are configured
for the mission. This process is commonly referred to as a “DMS sweep”. A DMS sweep may be conducted in
accordance with crewmember preferences, but it is important to be consistent and coordinate with the other
crewmember to ensure any settings that are common between crewstations are agreed upon and the start-up
process is conducted in an efficient manner. (© Denotes “common” options or settings)

2.    [[**PLT**]]   Standby Attitude Indicator – Uncage.
3.    [[**PLT & CPG**]]   Area around helicopter – Clear.   

4.     [[**PLT**]] RTR BRK switch – OFF (or LOCK if

    During normal operations, Engine 1 is started first,
followed by Engine 2. The APU must remain in
operation until the engine POWER levers are set to
FLY and the NR has stabilized at 101%, otherwise the
AC generators will drop offline and the aircraft will
lose primary electrical power.

6.    [[**PLT**]]   First engine – Start as follows:

    !!! note

        During the start, if any of the following conditions are observed, abort the start by moving the
        corresponding POWER lever to OFF:

        - It appears the TGT will exceed 851°C prior to NG reaching the idle speed of 63%.
        - No increase of TGT, NP, or ENG OIL PSI within 45 seconds after moving the POWER lever to IDLE.
        - The ENG 1/2 START advisory is removed from the EUFD prior to the NG reaching 52%.
 
    -  ENG START switch – START; observe “ENG 1 START” or “ENG 2 START” advisory displayed on the
            EUFD and the START box displayed on the ENG page.
 
    -  POWER lever – IDLE, at first indication of NG increase and if TGT is less than 80° C.
 
    -  Cockpit indications – Monitor.
        - Engine TGT
        - Engine NG
        - Engine OIL PSI
        - EUFD Advisory column

7.    [[**PLT**]]   Second Engine – Repeat the steps above after first engine start sequence is complete.
8.    [[**PLT**]]   RTR BRK switch – OFF.

    !!! note

        Prior to advancing the POWER levers to FLY, confirm the ENGINE OIL PSI indications for both engines
        are less than 70 PSI.

        If performing operations in cold weather, confirm the NGB TEMP °C indications are
        above 20° C.

        (see [ENG Systems sub-page](09.mpd.md#eng-systems-sys-sub-page) for more information.)

9.     [[**PLT**]] POWER levers – Advance both POWER levers smoothly to FLY; ensure the TORQUE % indications for
      both engines increase simultaneously.

10.   [[**PLT**]]   NP and NR – Verify 101%.
11.   [[**PLT**]]   MSTR WARN, MSTR CAUT, and EUFD – Monitor for any malfunction indications.
12.   [[**PLT**]]   APU button – Press and release to initiate APU shutdown sequence.
