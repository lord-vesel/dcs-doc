# Multi-Purpose Displays (MPD)

The Multi-Purpose Displays (MPDs) are color liquid crystal displays that allow the Pilot and CPG to access different
pages and/or formats of information. Each page allows the crewmember to view different information or access
different functions. There are two MPDs in each crewstation. The MPDs are identical; either can display any page,
sub-page, or format. Many functions that would be controlled by switches or physical controls in other aircraft
are included as MPD functions in the AH-64D.

If on the ground while on external power and the engine Power Levers set to OFF, the MPDs will enter a
screensaver mode if no buttons are pressed within 5 minutes. Pressing any button on either MPD will re-initialize
turn them back on.

1. **M Button**. Variable Action Button B1 is used to access the Menu and DMS pages.

    - Menu page: If any page is displayed on the MPD other than the Menu page, this button will display
          the Menu page.

    - DMS page: If the Menu page is displayed on the MPD, this button will access the DMS page.



#### Auto-paging

Some MPD pages will be displayed automatically when certain events occur; this is called “auto-paging”.
Autopaging by the DMS system is automatic and contextual based on specific aircraft conditions.
DMS autopaging can be suppressed in the CPG crewstation from the DMS Utility page.

- The ENG page will display in Emergency format when a new Warning message is displayed.

- The ENG page will display in Emergency format when the EMERG HYD button on the Emergency panel
      in either crewstation is pressed.

- The ENG page will display when an ENG START switch is engaged on the Pilot’s Power Quadrant panel.

ASE autopaging occurs when a threat is detected that exceeds the ASE Autopage threshold set within the
crewstation on the TSD Utility or ASE pages. (See Aircraft Survivability Equipment for more information.)

- The TSD page will display when the RLWR or RFI detects radar or laser energy exceeding the ASE
          Autopage threshold. If the ASE page is displayed, ASE autopaging is suppressed.

FCR autopaging occurs when the FCR is selected as that crewstation’s sight.

#### Variable Action Button (VAB) Functions

The function of a Variable Action Button is indicated by the format of its label. When a VAB command is in-
progress, the label will be displayed in “inverse video”.
                                                          



**Page button**

![](img/img-110-1-screen.jpg)


Displays a different MPD page or
sub-page, annotated by an
arrow. When a sub-page is
accessed, the button label will be
boxed.



**Momentary button**

![](img/img-110-2-screen.jpg)

Commands an action. The
button
displayed in inverse video
while the action is being
performed.



**Maintained button**

![](img/img-110-3-screen.jpg)

**Search buttons**

![](img/img-111-2-screen.jpg)

Scrolls up and down
through a list of grouped
button options.



#### MPD Cursor

Each crewstation has an independent MPD cursor for accessing MPD commands or interacting with
MPD displayed data and symbols. The Cursor Controller on the Collective Mission Grips and TEDAC
Left Handgrip is used to slew the cursor on the active MPD. The cursor provides the crewmembers
a means to select VAB commands on the MPD without removing their hands from the flight controls
or the TEDAC handgrips. When placed over a VAB label, the label text will be bolded to indicate
Cursor-Enter can be pressed.

![](img/img-111-3-screen.jpg)

The cursor can be moved to the opposite MPD using the Cursor Display Select button on the
Collective Mission Grip or TEDAC Left Handgrip or by “bumping” the cursor between MPDs. To
bump the cursor to the opposite display, move the cursor to the inboard edge of the MPD, release input on the
Cursor Controller, and then re-apply pressure input toward the opposite MPD. The cursor can also be utilized on
the TDU in the CPG crewstation if the FCR page is displayed on the TDU. However, the cursor can only be moved
to the TDU FCR display using the “bump” method.

The MPD cursor itself may be displayed in several formats, depending on the specific page that is displayed on
the MPD and the position of the cursor itself.

**Normal format**

![](img/img-111-4-screen.jpg)

The cursor may be used for selecting
Variable Action Button commands
along the bezel of the MPD.

**Crosshairs format**

![](img/img-111-5-screen.jpg)

The cursor may be used for selecting
symbols or map locations within the
central “footprint” of the MPD page.


**Symbol Select format**

![](img/img-111-6-screen.jpg)

A symbol is identified for cursor
selection using Cursor-Enter.

**Target Reference Point format**

![](img/img-111-7-screen.jpg)

The cursor is being used to place a
TRP-shaped Priority Fire Zone on the
TSD Battle Area Management page.

**Opposite Crewmember format**

![](img/img-111-8-screen.jpg)

Distinguishes the cursor belonging to
the opposite crewmember from the
crewmember’s own cursor, if enabled
for display on the TSD.



#### MPD Symbology Colors

All MPD pages share a 6-color template for consistent indication of various types of symbology. These colors
increase the efficiency of a crewmember’s interpretation and prioritization of displayed data within the cockpit.


- Green. Default symbology color, normal conditions, and Advisory messages.

- Yellow. Hazards to flight, intermediate or transient operating conditions, and Caution messages

- Red. Targets, enemy threats, conditions exceeding allowable parameters, and Warning messages.

- White. Items requiring a crewmember’s attention, or invalid selection/data.

- Cyan. Ownship, friendly units, pitch attitudes above the horizon (sky).

- Brown. Pitch attitudes below the horizon (ground).

In addition to colors, the intensity of the symbology itself may also be adjusted to indicate relevance or recency
of the information.


- Full-intensity color. Relevant or current data.

- Partial-intensity color. Less relevant or stale data.

### Menu (M) Page

The Menu page provides immediate access to any “top-level” MPD page within the three page categories, as well
as the DMS, VIDEO, VCR, and Favorites (*) pages. The Menu page may be accessed at any time by pressing the
M button (VAB B1).

![](img/img-113-1-screen.jpg)


#### Page Categories

Most MPD pages are grouped within one of three categories: AIRCRAFT, COMMUNICATIONS, and MISSION.


**AIRCRAFT pages**


Aircraft systems.

- ENG Engine and powertrain information 
- FLT Flight instruments 
- FUEL Fuel systems 
- PERF Performance data 
- UTIL Utility systems


**COMMUNICATION pages**


Communication systems. 

- DL Datalink 
- XPNDR Transponder 
- UHF UHF radio 
- FM FM1/FM2 radios 
- HF HF radio 
- COM Comms presets and network management


**MISSION pages**


Navigation, weapons, radar, and defensive systems. 

- ASE Aircraft Survivability Equipment 
- TSD Tactical Situation Display 
- WPN Weapon systems 
- FCR Fire Control Radar


### Engine (ENG) Page

The ENG page displays engine and powertrain data and is displayed in either Ground, Flight, or Emergency
formats, based on aircraft status. ENG page data may be displayed as digital numerical values and/or analog
vertical tapes.
  
-    Values displayed in green represent normal operating parameters.

-    Values displayed in yellow represent intermediate or transient operating parameters that will result in
           component damage or fatigue if maintained continuously.

-    Values displayed in red represent maximum operating parameters that have been exceeded that has
               most likely resulted in component damage or fatigue and may result in imminent failure.

For data that is also displayed as an analog tape, the entire vertical tape is color-coded to indicate operating
condition, and the width of the tape will widen when outside of normal operating parameters. The increase in
the width of the tape allows crewmembers to recognize when indications are outside normal operating parameters
when the MPD is set to MONO (monochromatic) mode.



#### Engine Page, Ground format

During initial start-up of the APU, the ENG page will be displayed in Ground format, with engine oil and hydraulic
pressure windows displayed in the lower half of the page. The ENG page will return to Ground format any time
the ENG START switches are moved to the START or IGN ORIDE positions on the Pilot’s Power Quadrant panel.

![](img/img-114-1-screen.jpg)

1. **Engine NG Tachometer**. Displays the gas generator speed of engines 1 and 2, as a percentage.

1. **Engine Start Box**. Displayed when either Air Turbine Starter (ATS) is engaged in the START or IGN ORIDE
    modes.

    - If either ENG START switch is positioned to the START position on the Pilot’s Power Quadrant panel,
          “ON” will be displayed under the corresponding NG digital readout to indicate that a normal start
          sequence has been initiated for that engine.

    - If the ENG START switch is positioned to the IGN ORIDE position on the Pilot’s Power Quadrant panel,
          “OVRD” will be displayed under the corresponding NG digital readout to indicate that the engine is being
          motored by the ATS.

1. **Hydraulic System Pressures (PSI)**. Displays the hydraulic pressures of the primary (PRI) and utility
    (UTIL) hydraulic systems, and the hydraulic accumulator (ACC), in pounds-per-square-inch. The hydraulic

1. **Engine TORQUE % (Indications & limits)**. Displays the
    torque, as a percentage, that is being exerted by engines 1 and 2
    on the powertrain system as measured at each engines’ power
    turbine output shaft. The analog tapes and digital readouts will be
    displayed separately for each engine in red when above these
    limits under these conditions.

    The red maximum limit is dynamic and will re-position based on
    the maximum allowable torque for the current conditions, which
    is driven by the main rotor RPMs (NR) and whether the aircraft is
    operating under dual- or single-engine power.
    
    If NR is <50% the TQ red line will
    be displayed at 30%.

    ![](img/img-116-2-screen.jpg)

    If NR is <90% the TQ red line will
    be displayed at 70%.

    ![](img/img-116-3-screen.jpg)

    If NR is >90% the TQ red line will be displayed at 115% under dual engine
    power and at 125% under single-engine power.

    ![](img/img-116-4-screen.jpg)

    If either TQ indicates <51%, the other engine’s TGT limiter is increased to
    896 °C, allowing the healthy engine to operate in a single-engine
    contingency mode. A yellow sub-range limit will be displayed at 123% within
    both TQ analog tape ranges above the TQ digital readout, delineating
    between the 2.5-minute single-engine contingency range and the 6-second
    single-engine transient range.
    
    If either engine TQ enters the dual-engine transient operating
    range (101-115% when NR is >90%) a 6-second countdown timer          
    will be displayed instead of the engine numbers below the analog
    tapes.
                                                                         
    If either engine TQ enters a single-engine contingency range (111-
    122% when NR is >90%) a 2.5-minute countdown timer will be           

    displayed instead of the engine numbers below the analog tapes.
    If either engine TQ enters a single-engine transient operating range 

    (123-125% when NR is >90%) a 6-second countdown timer will be
    displayed instead of the engine numbers below the analog tapes.

    Each engine incorporates a TGT limiter within the
    Digital Electronic Control that will limit the engine to  
    a maximum TGT of 867±12 °C when under dual
    engine conditions, or 896±12 °C when under single-
    engine conditions.
                                                              
    If either engine’s torque indicates <51%, the other
    engine’s TGT limiter is increased to 896±12 °C,
    allowing the healthy engine to operate in a single-
    engine contingency mode for 2.5 minutes.

    TGT timers indicate the maximum acceptable time
    limit for the intermediate, contingency, and transient
    operating ranges.

    range, a 30-minute (811-870 °C) or 10-minute (871-
    878 °C) countdown timer will be displayed instead
    of the engine numbers below the analog tapes.
                                                              
    If under single-engine power, a third intermediate
    sub-range limit will be displayed, delineating
    between the 2.5-minute single-engine contingency
    range (879-896 °C) and the 12-second transient
    range (897-949 °C). When operating within these
    ranges, a 2.5-minute or 12-second timer will be

    dimensional velocity is <5 knots ground speed, or if the aircraft is weight-on-wheels.

1. **Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI)**. The Vertical Speed Indicator moves up and down the rate-of-climb scale
    to indicate vertical speed. The VSI becomes saturated at the ±1,000 fpm tick marks at the top or bottom of
    the Rate-of-climb Scale, augmented by digital readouts of rate-of-climb in 100 fpm increments.

1. **Rate-of-climb Scale**. Major tick marks are placed at 0, ±500 and ±1,000 feet per minute (fpm) rates of
    climb/descent. Minor tick marks are placed in 100 fpm increments between 0 and ±500 fpm. When the rate-
    of-climb/descent exceeds ±1,000 fpm, a digital readout to the nearest 100 fpm value is displayed adjacent
    to the 1,000 fpm major tick marks.
     When Altitude Hold is engaged, a rounded “homeplate” box is displayed next to the Rate-of-climb Scale at
     0 fpm.

1. **Radar Altitude**. Indicates the radar-detected altitude above ground level from 0 to 1,428 feet. The Radar
    Altitude is displayed in increments of 1 foot from 0 to 50 feet in altitude, and increments of 10 feet between

    above ground level.

1. **Turn Rate Indicator**. Indicates the rate of turn as the aircraft enters a bank. The rate of turn is displayed
    as a solid square moving underneath three “doghouses”. The center doghouse cooresponds with no turn
    (level attitude), and the left and right doghouses coorespond with standard-rate turns to the left and right,
    respectively. If the indicator is located between the center doghouse and either of the outer doghouses, the
    aircraft is in a half-standard-rate turn.

1. **Skid/Slip Indicator**. Also called the “trim ball”; indicates whether the aircraft is in coordinated flight (also
    known as “in aerodynamic trim”, or simply “in trim”). With the ball is centered between the tick marks, the
    aircraft is in coordinated flight, which minimizes drag. If the ball is left of center, applying left pedal will
    adjust tail rotor thrust to bring the aircraft back into coordinated flight. Likewise, if the ball is right of center,
    applying right pedal will adjust tail rotor thrust to bring the aircraft back into coordinated flight.

          based on the current or predicted gross weight and air density.

    - Hover Torque – GO-NO/GO IGE. Displays the predicted hover torque
          required to hover in-ground-effect at 5 feet over the surface, at the maximum allowable gross weight
          specified for dual-engine, in-ground-effect (IGE) hovering flight, based on the air density.

    - Hover Torque – GO-NO/GO OGE. Displays the predicted hover torque required to hover in-ground-
          effect at 5 feet over the surface, at the maximum allowable gross weight specified for dual-engine,
          out-of-ground-effect (OGE) hovering flight, based on the air density.

    - Hover Torque – INDICATED. Displays the current engine torque value, the highest of the two
          engines, in 1% increments. If the difference in engine torque values exceeds 12%, the torque value
          will flash.

1. **Cruise Status Window**. Displays predicted engine torque and fuel flow values at cruise airspeeds, based
     on air density and gross weight. The values in this status window are used to assess the performance and
     fuel flow requirements when flying at either Maximum Range or Maximum Endurance airspeeds.

    - CRUISE – Q RNG. Displays the predicted engine torque (Q) required to
        ![](img/img-134-2-screen.jpg){align=right}
          maintain level flight at Maximum Range (RNG) airspeed, based on the predicted
          gross weight and air density.

    - CRUISE – Q END. Displays the predicted engine torque (Q) required to maintain

     and gross weight. The values in this status window are used to maintain the aircraft within safe flight margins
     or to maximize the performance of the aircraft.

    - TAS – VNE. Displays the true airspeed Velocity Never Exceed (VNE), based on the
        ![](img/img-134-3-screen.jpg){align=right}
          predicted gross weight and air density. If the true airspeed exceeds this value,
          controllability of the aircraft may be negatively affected, or structural damage may
          occur due to aerodynamic effects on the airframe and/or rotor system.

    - TAS – VSSE. Displays the true airspeed Velocity Safe Single Engine (VSSE), based on
          the predicted gross weight, air density, and maximum torque available under single-

          surface, under dual-engine (DE) power, based on the air density.

    - MAX GWT – DE OGE. Displays the maximum allowable gross weight in
          which a hover can be maintained out-of-ground-effect (OGE), at 80 feet
          over the surface, under dual-engine (DE) power, based on the air density.

    - MAX GWT – SE IGE. Displays the maximum allowable gross weight in which a hover can be
          maintained in-ground-effect (IGE), at 5 feet over the surface, under single-engine (SE) power, based
          on the air density.

    - MAX GWT – SE OGE. Displays the maximum allowable gross weight in which a hover can be
          maintained out-of-ground-effect (OGE), at 80 feet over the surface, under single-engine (SE) power,
          based on the air density.

1. **Max Torque Status Window**. ![](img/img-135-2-screen.jpg){align=right} Displays the maximum torque available from the engines, based on air
     density and engine condition. The values in this status window are used to assess how much torque can be
     demanded from the engines without causing a decay in rotor RPM (NR); also known as “rotor droop”.

    - MAX Q – DE. Displays the maximum torque (Q) available under dual-engine (DE)
          power.

    - MAX Q – SE. Displays the maximum torque (Q) available under single-engine (DE)
          power.

     NOTE: These values do not take into account the limitations of the engine nose gearboxes or the main
     transmission. The torques displayed in this window may be used for a short duration in an emergency, but
     will impart excessive loads into the powertrain system, likely incurring post-flight inspection or replacement.

1. **Wind Status Window**.

    ![](img/img-135-3-screen.jpg)

    Displays the current wind direction and velocity, as measured
     by the Helicopter Air Data System (HADS). 

1. **Center-of-Gravity Scale**.

    ![](img/img-135-4-screen.jpg)

    Displays the calculated
    longitudinal center-of-gravity (CG) of the aircraft, between a
    minimum of 201.0 inches and a maximum of 207.0 inches,
    referenced from the nose of the aircraft. The CG is calculated
    using the same data used to calculate the current aircraft
    gross weight.

1. **PERF Mode**. Sets the PERF calculation mode between Current conditions, Maximum conditions, and
    Planned conditions. The calculations displayed on the PERF page will be based on the conditions displayed
    (or input) within the selected mode.

    - CUR. Calculations performed on the PERF page are based on the current PA and FAT as measured by
          the HADS, and the current GWT as calculated by the SP.

    - MAX. Calculations performed on the PERF page are based on values of PA, FAT, and GWT, as manually
          input by the aircrew or loaded by the DTC.

    - PLAN. Calculations performed on the PERF page are based on values of PA, FAT, and GWT, as manually
          input by the aircrew or loaded by the DTC.

1. **HIT sub-page**. Displays the PERF Health Indicator Test sub-page. (N/I)

1. **WT format**. Displays the PERF Weight format.

#### PERF Weight (WT) Format

Pressing the WT button (VAB B6) displays the PERF page in Weight format. Pressing the WT button a second
time returns the PERF page to standard format. The Weight format allows either crewmember to enter the weight
of the aircrew and other equipment onboard the aircraft for performance and center-of-gravity calculations.

These values are typically configured in advance by maintenance personnel based on the aircraft configuration
of installed equipment. The aircrew is only required to update their own personal weights and any additional
survival equipment they may have loaded prior to the flight.

![](img/img-136-1-screen.jpg)


1. **Aircraft Basic Weight**. Activates the KU for inputting the basic weight and moment of the aircraft. The
        basic weight includes the weight of the aircraft itself, permanently installed equipment, hydraulic fluid,
        engine and transmission oil, and unusable fuel.
        Upon activation, the KU prompt will display “WEIGHT:”. After entering the weight into the KU and pressing
        ENTER, the prompt will display “MOMENT”, after which the empty moment (weight × arm) may be input.

1. **Left Aft Bay Weight**. Activates the KU for inputting the weight of any payload loaded within the left aft
        fuselage storage bay.

1. **Survival Kit Weight**. Activates the KU for inputting the weight of any payload loaded within the survival
        kit bay in the aft fuselage.

1. **Pilot Weight**. Activates the KU for inputting the weight of the Pilot (including clothing and gear).

1. **CPG Weight**. Activates the KU for inputting the weight of the Copilot/Gunner (including clothing and gear).

1. **Dummy Missiles Quantity**. Activates the KU for inputting the number of M34 dummy missiles loaded onto
        the aircraft (0–16). Dummy missiles are not automatically inventoried by the SP and must be input manually.

1. **Dummy Rockets Quantity**. Activates the KU for inputting the number of dummy rockets loaded onto the
        aircraft (0–76). Dummy rockets are not automatically inventoried by the SP and must be input manually.

### Utility (UTIL) Page

The UTIL page displays cockpit and outside air temperatures, and status of the ice detector. The page also
includes controls for managing the anti-ice components, environmental systems, and Flight Management
Computer (FMC) functions.

![](img/img-137-1-screen.jpg)


1. **Ice Detector Status**. Displays the level of ice accumulation sensed by the external ice detection probe.
     (N/I)

1. **Free Air Temperature**. Displays free air temperature in °C as sensed by the external HADS temperature
     probe.

1. **Cockpit Temperature**. Displays the current temperature within the crewstation. (N/I)

1. **FMC Controls**. Toggles individual Flight Management Computer functions.

    - PITCH. Enables/disables the FMC Pitch channel inputs to the longitudinal flight control servo.

    - ROLL. Enables/disables the FMC Roll channel inputs to the lateral flight control servo.

    - YAW. Enables/disables the FMC Pitch channel inputs to the directional flight control servo.

    - COLL. Enables/disables the FMC Pitch channel inputs to the collective flight control servo.

    - TRIM. Enables/disables the force trim magnetic brakes on the cyclic and pedals in the Pilot crewstation.
          Disabling this function will also disable the associated functions of the Force Trim/Hold Mode switch on
          the cyclic.

    - NOE/A. Enables/disables Nap-of-the-Earth/Approach FMC mode. In NOE/A mode, the stabilator is
          commanded to 25° trailing edge down when airspeed is below 80 knots, but will revert to automatic
          mode when airspeed is 80 knots or greater. This improves “over-the-nose visibility” for low-altitude
          flight or during approach to landing.

1. **Anti-Ice Controls**. Toggles individual anti-ice elements. (N/I)

    - SYSTEM. Toggles the anti-ice system between Automatic and Manual modes of operation.
        - AUTO. Anti-ice systems are automatically enabled if ice is detected by the ice detect probe.
                    When ice is no longer detected, anti-ice systems will remain enabled but may be manually
                    disabled by the aircrew.
        - MANUAL. Anti-ice systems must be manually enabled by the aircrew.

    - PITOT. Enables/disables the electrical heating elements within the pitot and air data sensors.

    - INLET. Enables/disables the engine inlet and nose gearbox electrical heating elements.
        - NOTE: The engine inlet fairings and inlet guide vanes are heated using bleed air from the
                    engine compressor’s 5th stage. Activation of the INLET anti-ice heating will cause an increase
                    in turbine gas temperatures (TGT), which may incur TGT temperature limiting and loss of
                    rotor RPMs when operating at high power settings.

    - CANOPY. Enables/disables the electrical heating elements embedded in the forward canopy
          windscreens for the Pilot and CPG.

    - SENSOR. Enables/disables the electrical heating of the TADS/PNVS turret shrouds and sensor
          windows. The sensor anti-ice will be disabled with aircraft weight-on-wheels and will be inhibited from
          selection.

1. **Bleed Air Controls**. Enables/Disables the bleed air supply from engines 1 and 2.

1. **Cockpit Temperature Setting**. Activates the KU for inputting the desired crewstation temperature. Each
     crewstation can be set independently. (N/I)

1. **ECS Power**. Enables/Disables the Environmental Control System (ECS).

### Tactical Situation Display (TSD) Page

The Tactical Situation Display presents a top-down overview of the battlespace around the aircraft. The TSD is a
versatile, full color, moving map that fuses pre-planned mission data with real-time information and symbology
received from the various onboard sensors, or received from offboard platforms through the datalink modem.

The TSD in each crewstation can be independently customized by each crewmember to tailor the information
displayed based on the mission, changes in the tactical environment, and personal preferences. The TSD is also
used as the aircrew’s primary navigational display, whether performing a simple training flight in the local
airspace, using the ADF receiver for radio-based navigation in low-visibility conditions, or navigating to an tactical
objective within a combat area.

The Point (POINT), Route (RTE), and Instrument (INST) sub-pages are described in the Navigation chapter.
The Report (RPT), Shot (SHOT), Fuel/Ammo/Rockets/Missiles (FARM), and Battle Area Management (BAM) sub-
pages are described in the Datalink chapter.

![](img/img-139-1-screen.jpg)


1. **PAN sub-page**. Displays the TSD Pan sub-page.

1. **SHOW sub-page**. Displays the TSD Show sub-page.

1. **Message Receive (REC)**. Displays the Receive selection menu for receiving datalink messages.

1. **Ownship**. Indicates the present location of the aircraft.

1. **Waypoint Status**. Displays the point selected for navigation, its distance in kilometers or nautical miles,
    and estimated time enroute (ETE). The ETE is based on the aircraft’s current ground speed, and is presented
    in HH:MM format when the ETE is ≥5 minutes, or M:SS format when ETE is <5 minutes. The ETE is not
    displayed when ground speed is <15 knots or ETE is >10 hours. Waypoint Status information is not displayed
    if there is no active destination point.

     NOTE: The Waypoint Status window is not displayed when the TSD is set to Attack (ATK) Phase.

1. **SA Overlay**. Not implemented.

1. **Command Heading**. Indicates the magnetic heading to the point selected for navigation.

1. **Grid Status**. Displays the distance between each TSD grid line in kilometers or nautical miles. If GRID is
    disabled on the MAP sub-page, the Grid Status window will not be displayed.

1. **Scale Setting**. Adjusts the scale of the TSD up or down. The current setting is shown between the arrow
    buttons and is scaled based on the UNIT (KM/NM) selection within the crewstation on the FLT Settings page.
    The available TSD scales are shown below:

    - 400 KM/216 NM
    - 150 KM/81 NM
    - 100 KM/54 NM
    - 75 KM/40.5 NM
    - 50 KM/27 NM
    - 25 KM/13.5 NM
    - 15 KM/8.1 NM
    - 10 KM/5.4 NM
    - 5 KM/2.7 NM
    - 2 KM/1.1 NM
    - 1 KM/0.5 N

     When either of the scale buttons are depressed for more than 1 second, the TSD scale will become bolded
     and will smoothly zoom in/out while retaining the current chart scale. If neither scale button is pressed for
     1 second, the zoom function will be disabled and the TSD scale buttons will revert to normal function.

1. **Freeze Mode (FRZ)**.

    When enabled, sets the TSD to Freeze mode. All TSD symbology and
    navigation data will continue to update as normal, but the focal point of the TSD “footprint”
    will be the white Ghostship symbol. The cyan Ownship symbol will continue to move across
    the map independently of the TSD footprint to display the actual aircraft position. (See TSD
    Pan sub-page for more information.)

    ![](img/img-140-1-screen.jpg)

     FRZ mode may also be enabled by cursor-selecting any location within the TSD footprint
     when no other MPD cursor action is available, such as CAQ or point-select.

1. **Cursor Acquisition (CAQ)**. Enables the cursor to designate a point on the TSD as the acquisition Source.
    After pressing the CAQ button, the TSD will enter Freeze mode and enable any points displayed within the
    TSD footprint to be selected by the MPD cursor. Pressing Cursor-Enter when over a point symbol designates
    that point as the acquisition source.
     Acquisition selection may be a Waypoint, Hazard, Control Measure, pre-planned or stored Target/Threat, or
     an FCR detected target. If a map location on the TSD is selected instead of a point, a Terrain point (TRN
     PT) is created at that location. If a Terrain point is designated, the location is stored as Target/Threat points
     T55 (PLT) or T56 (CPG) in the COORD file (see TSD Coordinates sub-page). A white cross labeled “PLT” or
     “CPG” will appear on the map.

1. **Acquisition Source (ACQ)**. Displays the acquisition source selection menu. (See Acquisition Sources in
    the Tactical Employment chapter for more information.)

1. **Endurance Status (EN)**. Displays the remaining flight time (endurance) until fuel is depleted, based on
    the TOT (Total) endurance calculation. If the endurance calculation equals 20 minutes or less, the time
    remaining will be displayed in white and “EN” will flash.
     NOTE: If the calculated fuel flow to the engines is “0” (when the engines are off), the Endurance Status
     window is not displayed.

1. **Wind Status**. Displays the wind speed and direction of origin as computed by the aircraft Helicopter Air
    Data System (HADS). If wind speed is computed as <5 knots, the Wind Status will display “CALM”. If the
    NR is <50% and wind speed is >45 knots, the Wind Status will display the wind speed in yellow.

    ![](img/img-141-1-screen.jpg)



1. **Present Position**. When enabled, displays the Present Position Status window below the Ownship.

1. **Present Position Status**. Displays the Ownship aircraft’s MGRS coordinates, Latitude/Longitude
    coordinates, and the aircraft’s altitude in feet above mean sea level (MSL).

1. **TSD Phase**. Sets the TSD Phase to Navigation (NAV) or Attack (ATK). The TSD will display different
    elements of information relevant to the corresponding phase of the mission. Many of these elements may
    be configured within each crewstation based on crewmember preferences or mission requirements. (See
    TSD Show sub-page and TSD Coordinates Show sub-pages for more information.)

    - NAV. The Navigation phase is used for flights to and from the combat area. As such, its default Show
          settings are configured with a focus on navigation, routing, and avoidance of obstacles. However, most
          Show settings can be enabled/disabled similar to the Attack phase, with a few exceptions:

        -   Waypoint symbols and the current Route cannot be hidden.

        -   Low-priority FCR target symbols cannot be seen.

        -   Shot-At symbols cannot be seen.

    - ATK. The Attack phase is used for operations within the combat area or in the vicinity of the objective.
          As such, its default Show settings are configured with a focus on pre-planned targets and threats, FCR
          targeting data, and avoidance of obstacles. However, most Show settings can be enabled/disabled
          similar to the Navigation phase, with a few exceptions:

        -   Waypoint Status window cannot be seen.

        -   Only waypoints that are part of the current Route can be seen if CURRENT ROUTE is enabled. In
                 addition, waypoints set as the crewmember’s acquisition source can also be seen.

        -   Low-priority FCR target symbols can be seen, if enabled.

        -   Shot-At symbols can be seen.

1. **TADS Footprint**. Displays a top-down representation of the TADS line-of-
    sight and range when the CPG’s selected sight is set to TADS. The distance
    between the Ownship and the crosshairs represent the CPG’s current range
    value and may not directly represent the true range to the location seen
    through the TADS line-of-sight itself.
    When the TADS Laser Rangefinder/Designator (LRFD) is firing, the solid
    green line projected between the Ownship and the TADS Footprint will be
    displayed in white.

1. **Center Mode (CTR)**.

    ![](img/img-142-1-screen.jpg)

    When enabled, sets the TSD to Center mode, in
    which the TSD is centered on the Ownship. When disabled, the TSD is
    focused forward of the Ownship in a depressed mode.

1. **POINT sub-page**. Displays the TSD Point sub-page.

1. **BAM sub-page**. Displays the TSD Battle Area Management sub-page.

1. **MAP sub-page**. Displays the TSD Map sub-page.

1. **RTE sub-page**. Displays the TSD Route sub-page.

#### TSD Pan (PAN) Sub-page

The PAN sub-page allows the crewmember to move and rotate the map independently of the Ownship location
and orientation. When using the PAN sub-page, the TSD is automatically set to Freeze mode, indicated by a
dashed border displayed around the “TSD footprint”.

The PAN sub-page not only allows the aircrew to view areas of the battlespace from a different perspective, it
also allows them to more effectively plan, modify, or preview different aspects of the mission from within the
aircraft itself, which may become necessary due to changes on the battlefield. As such, the PAN sub-page is a
critical extension of other TSD functions on the Point (POINT), Route (RTE), or Battle Area Management (BAM)
sub-pages.

![](img/img-143-1-screen.jpg)


1. **TSD Heading**. Adjusts the heading of the TSD footprint independently of the aircraft heading. Pressing the
     left arrow (VAB T4) or right arrow (VAB T6) rotates the map in 1° increments for each momentary press, or
     40° each second when pressed and held. Alternatively, HDG> (VAB T5) can be used to activate the KU for
     directly inputting the desired TSD heading.

1. **Pan to Point**. Activates the KU for inputting a point within the navigational database. After entry, the TSD
     will pan to the location of the point so that it is centered within the TSD footprint.

1. **Pan to next Route Point**. The Ghostship will pan to the corresponding point along the currently selected
     route and will orient toward the required heading on course to the subsequent route point. This can be used
     to preview the current route as if it were being flown in a sequential order as planned.

1. **Route Pan**. The Ghostship will pan along the route. Pressing the up arrow (VAB L3) or down arrow (VAB
     L4) will advance the Ghostship along the route a distance equal to one TSD grid square. When the up or
     down arrows are pressed and held, the TSD footprint will smoothly pan along the route in a continuous
     motion.

1. **Pan to previous Route Point**. The TSD footprint will pan to the corresponding point along the currently
     selected route and will orient toward the required heading on course to the subsequent route point. This
     can be used to preview the current route as if it were being flown in a reversed sequential order as planned.

    ![Panning to each subsequent Route Point](img/img-144-1-screen.jpg)

    ![Panning continuously in reverse](img/img-144-2-screen.jpg)

1. **Pan Mode**. Sets the PAN mode to either CURSR (default mode) or NORM mode.

    - CURSR. The TSD footprint may be moved in any direction using the Cursor Controller on the Collective
          Mission Grip or the TEDAC Left Handgrip in the CPG crewstation. Pressing Cursor-Enter will switch the
          mode to NORM.

    - NORM. The TSD footprint is re-centered on the MPD cursor location each time Cursor-Enter is pressed
          on the Collective Mission Grip or the TEDAC Left Handgrip, or the Alternate Cursor Enter Trigger is
          pulled on the Collective Mission Grip or the Alternate Cursor Enter button is pressed on the TEDAC
          Right Handgrip.

1. **Pan Cursor**. When the MPD cursor is assigned to an MPD that is displaying the TSD PAN sub-page while
     the PAN mode is set to CURSR, the cursor is placed in the bottom left corner of the MPD. The TSD footprint
     is slaved to the MPD cursor and will move with it until PAN mode is toggled to NORM, PAN sub-page is
     exited, or the MPD cursor is re-assigned to the opposite MPD using the Cursor Display Select button on the
     Collective Mission Grip or the TEDAC Left Handgrip.

1. **Freeze Footprint**. Indicates the TSD is in Freeze mode. All TSD symbology and navigation data will
     continue to update as normal, but the focal point of the TSD footprint will be the white Ghostship symbol.
     The cyan Ownship symbol will continue to move across the map independently of the TSD footprint to
     display the actual aircraft position.

1. **Ghostship**. Indicates the focal point of the TSD footprint any time the TSD is in Freeze mode.

1. **Last Pan**. Resets the TSD to the previous location and heading prior to the most
    recent Pan action.

1. **Altitude Control**. Enables/disables the Ghostship altitude controls. This option is
    only displayed when COLOR BAND is set to A/C or ELEV on the MAP sub-page.

1. **Altitude Controls**. Adjusts the Ghostship’s altitude above ground level (AGL)
    independently of the Ownship. Pressing the up arrow (VAB R3) or down arrow
    (VAB R5) adjusts the altitude in 10 foot increments for each momentary press, or
    10 feet each second when pressed and held. Alternatively, ATL> (VAB R4) can be
    used to activate the KU for directly inputting the desired Ghostship altitude.

    ![](img/img-144-3-screen.jpg)

#### TSD Show (SHOW) Sub-page

The SHOW sub-page allows each crewmember to configure their TSD to suit the mission, tactical situation, or
personal preferences. In addition, independent SHOW options are available for the Navigation and Attack phases.

##### NAV Phase


![](img/img-145-1-screen.jpg)

The Navigation Phase is used for flights to and from the combat area. As such, the default SHOW settings (shown
below) are configured with a focus on navigation, routing, and avoidance of obstacles.


1. **SA sub-page**. Not implemented.

          beyond the left and right MPD boundaries.

    - VIEW – ZOOM. Video underlay will be displayed in Zoom aspect. Enlarges the source video but does
          not increase resolution. Some video area will not be seen beyond the MPD boundaries.

1. **Sharpness**. Adjusts the sharpness of the video underlay. Increasing the sharpness improves detection of
     fine details but also increases the intensity of video noise.

1. **Video Color**. Sets the color scale of the video underlay.

    - WHITE. Video underlay is displayed in a grayscale, with brighter shades increasing in white intensity
          and darker shades decreasing in intensity to black.

    - GREEN. Video underlay is displayed in a greenscale, with brighter shades increasing in green intensity
          and darker shades decreasing in intensity to black.
          This may be used to set the video underlay to a greenscale independently of the symbology overlay.
          This allows the crewmember to retain full MPD brightness and color symbology without setting the
          MPD mode to MONO.

1. **Underlay Select**. Selects the video source for display as an underlay on the MPD.

    - UNDERLAY – TADS. Displays TADS sensor video.
          NOTE: The TADS Weapon symbology crosshair is incorporated as part of the video underlay and will
          be displayed even if the VID page is not set to VSEL format.

    - UNDERLAY – CPG SIGHT. Displays video from the CPG’s selected sight. If the MPD is not showing
          a video underlay when the CPG displays the VID page, this video underlay option is automatically
          selected.

    - UNDERLAY – CPG HMD. Displays video from the CPG’s helmet-mounted display.

    - UNDERLAY – PLT SIGHT. Displays video from the Pilot’s selected sight.

    - UNDERLAY – PLT HMD. Displays video from the Pilot’s helmet-mounted display. If the MPD is not
          showing a video underlay when the Pilot displays the VID page, this video underlay option is
          automatically selected.

    - UNDERLAY – NO VIDEO. No video underlay will be displayed on the MPD. VSEL format selection
          (VAB B6) is blanked.

1. **Symbology Contrast**. Sets the relative brightness of the video underlay compared to the remainder of the
     symbology displayed on the MPD.

    - NORM. Displays video using the normal video brightness scale.

    - BOOST. Displays video using a reduced brightness scale in order to boost the apparent brightness of
          the symbology in contrast to the video underlay.

1. **Reset Settings**. Resets the VID page options to their default settings.
        - View Aspect: NORM
        - Sharpness: Level 3 of 7
        - Video Color: WHITE

1. **Grayscale**. Displays grayscale calibration images along the top and bottom of the MPD for ensuring all
     shades of the video underlay are easily visible with the current VID page options and MPD brightness/mode
     settings.

#### Video Select (VSEL) Format

Pressing the VSEL button (VAB T6) displays the VID page in Video Select format. Pressing the VSEL button a
second time returns the VID page to standard format. The Video Select format allows the crewmember to view
the selected video underlay in a decluttered video/symbology format.

![](img/img-167-1-screen.jpg)

1. **View Aspect**. Sets the video aspect for any video underlay displayed on the MPD.

    - VIEW – W. Video underlay will be displayed in Wide aspect. All video will be seen but with significant
         blank space above and below the video boundaries.

    - VIEW – N. Video underlay will be displayed in Normal aspect. Some video area will not be seen beyond
         the left and right MPD boundaries.

    - VIEW – Z. Video underlay will be displayed in Zoom aspect. Enlarges the source video but does not
         increase resolution. Some video area will not be seen beyond the MPD boundaries.

1. **Sharpness**. Adjusts the sharpness of the video underlay. Increasing the sharpness improves detection of
     fine details but also increases the intensity of video noise.
