APPENDIX B – ALIC CODES & RWR SYMBOLS
The Aircraft Launcher Interface Computer (ALIC) codes listed under the “ID” column in the Air Defense and Naval
Radar Systems tables can be used on the HARM DED page or HTS DED page to program custom threat tables
for the AGM-88 HARM or HARM Targeting System radar signal scans.
The threat radar codes under the “RWR” column correspond with how the threat radar will appear on the ALR-
56M Threat Warning Azimuth Indicator, the MFD HARM Attack Display (HAD) format, or the MFD Weapon (WPN)
format when the AGM-88 weapon profile is selected.
Air defense radar systems are further identified by their type. The table below lists the definition of each “Type”
abbreviation to identify the radar’s function within their respective air defense units.

APPENDIX C – HAD / WPN THREAT TABLES
The threat radar codes under the “HAD” column correspond with how the threat radar will appear on the MFD
HARM Attack Display (HAD) format if the corresponding threat class is enabled within the HTS scan cycles.
The HAD Manual threat Class is programmable via the HTS DED page and can include up to eight threat radar
types. This can be used to better tailor the HTS scan cycles to the radar signals that are anticipated to be
encountered during the mission.

Each HARM threat table can be modified using the HARM DED page. This can be used to better tailor the AGM-
88 scans to the radar signals that are anticipated to be encountered during the mission.

APPENDIX F – FORMULAS
Use these calculation and conversion formulas for pre-mission planning or while in flight. Desired resultants are
bolded.


Fuel/Endurance Calculations
Bingo Fuel (lbs) = (Time of Flight ÷ 60) × Fuel LB/HR
Objective Time (mins) = ([Total Fuel − Bingo Fuel] ÷ Fuel LB/HR) × 60


Speed/Time/Distance Calculations
Ground Speed Required (knots) = (Distance ÷ Minutes) × 60
Time of Flight (mins) = (Distance ÷ Ground Speed) × 60


Fuel/Range Calculations
Specific Range Factor = Ground Speed ÷ Fuel LB/HR
Flight Range (NM) = Specific Range Factor × Total Fuel


Distance Conversion
Nautical Miles (NM) to feet (ft) = [NM] x 6,076
Feet (ft) to Nautical Miles (NM) = [ft] ÷ 6,076
Nautical Miles (NM) to Kilometers (Km) = [NM] × 1.85
Kilometers (Km) to Nautical Miles (NM) = [Km] ÷ 1.85


Altitude/Elevation Conversion
Feet (ft) to Meters (m) = [ft] ÷ 3.281
Meters (m) to Feet (ft) = [m] × 3.281


Latitude/Longitude Conversion
DDD-MM-SS.SS to DDD-MM.MMM

          SS.SS ÷ 60 =         .MMM
DDD-MM.MMM to DDD-MM-SS.SS

        .MMM      × 60 =       SS.SS
Good hunting!
