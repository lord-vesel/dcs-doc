## ATTACK PREPARATION

Prior to reaching the target area and conducting your attack, you will want to configure several aircraft systems
ahead of time so that you can most efficiently communicate and set up your attack. When at a minimum of 40
nm from the target, you will want to take the following steps.
     1.   Position the Master Arm Switch to ARM. Weapons may be released normally when in the ARM position.
          If the Master Arm switch is placed in the OFF position, weapon release is inhibited.
     2.   Position the Laser Arm Switch to ARM. This is required to enable firing of the laser designator. Laser
          firing is inhibited with the switch set to OFF.




     3.   Place the fire control system in A-G mode by pressing the A-G Master Mode Button on the ICP.
