# UNGUIDED BOMBS

Unguided bombs that the F-16C can employ fall into three categories: General Purpose (GP), Cluster, and
Training.


General Purpose Bombs
Mk-82 LDGP. The standard Mk-82 is a low drag “slick” bomb, also referred to as a Low Drag General Purpose
(LDGP) bomb. The bomb is aerodynamically streamlined with four conical tail fins for flight stability. The bomb
has a thin steel jacket that contributes to fragmentation effects.
The Mk-82 may be carried singly on a Wing Weapons Pylon (WWP) or three may be loaded on a Triple Ejector
Rack (TER)
The Mk- 82 serves as the basis for several other bombs including the Mk-82 AIR, GBU-12, and GBU-38.
Mk-82 AIR. This version of the Mk-82 adds the BSU-49/B high drag tail assembly, also called a “ballute”. This
allows the bomb to rapidly slow down after release. By slowing down, you can release such a retarded weapon
at low altitude and not be caught in the blast effect of the weapon. You can choose to release the Mk-82AIR in
either retarded or “slick” (no ballute deployed) modes. To drop as a slick, select only a nose fuze, and to release
retarded, select nose/tail or tail fuze setting on the SMS page.
Mk-82 SE. This ‘Snake Eye” version of the Mk-82 pre-dates the Mk-82 AIR and uses fins that deploy from the
Mk-15 tail assembly to slow the bomb’s fall. You can choose to release the Mk-82 Snakeye in either retarded or
“slick” modes. To drop as a slick, select only a nose fuze, and to release retarded, select nose/tail or tail fuze
setting on the SMS page.
Mk-84 LDGP. The Mk-84 is the big brother of the Mk-82 and it weighs 2,039 lbs. with 945 lbs. of H-6 or Tritonal
high explosive. Although most effective against unarmored and lightly armored targets, the Mk-84 can also be
effective against armored targets when dropped in proximity. The Mk-84 can only be mounted on a WWP and
cannot be loaded on a TER.
The Mk-84 forms the basis for other bombs including the GBU-10 and GBU-31 that the F-16C also carries.


Cluster Bombs
CBU-87. The CBU-87 Combined Effects Munitions (CEM) weighs 950 lbs. and is an all-purpose cluster bomb.
The SUU-65 Tactical Munitions Dispenser that makes the body of the bomb contains 202 BLU-97/B Combined
Effects Munitions (CEM) bomblets and they are effective against lightly armored and unarmored targets. The
dispersal footprint of the bomblets depends on the Height of Function (HOF) and RPM spin setting set with dials
on the bomb and displayed on the SMS page. However, the general bomblet footprint coverage is 200 by 400
meters.
The CBU-87 can be mounted singly on a WWP. Only two may be loaded on a TER when wing external fuel tanks
are installed due to clearance constraints. This is commonly referred to as a ‘slant load’.
Each BLU-97/B CEB consists of a shaped charge, a scored steel casing, and a zirconium ring, for anti-armor and
anti-personnel fragmentation and incendiary effects. Each CEB is designed to fragment into 300 fragments. Given
the top attack angle of the weapon, the CEB can be effective against the generally light armor covering the top
of an armored vehicle such as a tank.
CBU-97. The CBU-97 is a 1,000-pound class weapon containing sensor-fuzed sub-munitions in a SUU-66B
Dispenser for specifically attacking armor. This Sensor Fuzed Weapon (SFW) contains 10 BLU-108/B sub-
munitions, and 40 “hockey puck” shaped skeet infrared sensing projectiles.
As with the CBU-87, the dispersal footprint of the bomblets depends on the Height of Function (HOF) set with
dials on the bomb and displayed on the SMS page. The RPM is not applicable on this dispenser. The same carriage
restrictions as the CBU-87 apply: one per WWP and two per TER.


Training Bombs
BDU-33. The BDU-33 is a miniaturized training bomb that mimics the ballistics of larger general-purpose bombs.
The BDU-33 contains a small smoke charge to help round spotting.


Unguided/Laser Guided Bombs SMS Page
The A-G SMS display and procedure for setting up an attack with guided or unguided bombs is very similar for
all types. The initial set-up will only be covered once, with differences in CCIP, CCRP sub-modes covered in
separate sections below.

  Summary
          1.     Select A-G Master Mode [2]
          2.     Select bombs and set desired options on SMS A-G MFD

Upon selection of the A-G master mode, the SMS Air-to-Ground (SMS A-G) page is displayed on the right MFD.
Based on the priority weapon, the information on the SMS A-G page can vary. Follow these steps to achieve the
correct configuration and attack ground targets with GP bombs in CCIP mode:
     1.        Select the desired weapons on the MFD by pressing OSB 6 until the weapons you want to
               release are displayed.



                                                                                            Weapon Status

                  Operating Mode                                                            Bombs    Remaining
                                                                                            and Type
                        Sub-mode


                                                                                            Selected Profile

                                                                                            Single / Pair Option
                                                                                            and Release Pulses
                    Fuzing Option
                                                                                            Release Interval Distance


                                                                                            Release Pulses Requested




                                                                                            System Status




     2.        Select the desired profile for the selected weapons.
               Two different profiles are pre-set by default. These include typical settings for delivery mode, fuze
               arming option, bomb impact spacing, and release quantity. If a profile already matches your planned
               attack profile, you are all set; no more changes are required! If not, follow the steps that follow in this
               section to set the profile up to your liking.
     Selecting the OSB next to the current profile to cycle between the two options: PROF1 and PROF2.




                                                                               Selected Profile




     Changes to settings made while a profile is selected are saved for later use. These should typically be
     set or verified as part of aircraft startup, although they may be changed at any time.
3.   Select your desired release sub-mode. (OSB 2)
     If a sub-mode other than the one you want is selected, you may press OSB 2 to display the following
     options.
          •    CCIP – Continuously Computed Impact Point
          •    CCRP – Continuously Computed Release Point
          •    DTOS – Dive Toss
          •    LADD – Low Altitude Drogue Delivery
          •    MAN – Manual
     Then, select the OSB next to your desired sub-mode. That will set the new active sub-mode and return
     you to the SMS A-G page.
     Sub-mode Options




     You may also cycle between sub-modes by pressing the Missile Step button on the Side Stick Controller
     (SSC).
4.   Set desired bomb fuzing option. (OSB 18)
     Bombs are typically equipped with two fuzes, one in the nose and one in the tail. These are sometimes
     set with different impact delay settings to provide the pilot with the choice of how the fuze functions
     and when the bomb detonates after impact. Sometimes an instantaneous detonation is desired for
     fragmentation effects and sometimes a delayed detonation is desired to allow target penetration or
     cratering.
     Selecting OSB 18 cycles between three fuze arming options: NOSE, TAIL and NSTL (Nose/Tail). This is
     typically set to NSTL (Nose/Tail) for redundancy unless a specific effect is desired when the weapon
     detonates.




              Fuzing Option
     There are also some special cases where the fuze option changes how the weapon behaves after
     release:
          •    Mk-82 AIR/SE
                   o    NSTL – High Drag
                   o    NOSE – Low Drag
                   o    TAIL – High Drag
          •    CBU-87/97
                   o    NSTL – Bomblets dispense using settings displayed on SMS page
                   o    NOSE – Bomblets dispense immediately after release
                   o    TAIL – Dud
5.   Set desired Single/Pair option. (OSB 8)
     Bombs may be released with either Single (SGL) or Pair (PAIR) selected. With SGL selected, bombs will
     be released from only one station. With PAIR selected, bombs will be released from both opposite
     stations, assuming identical bombs are loaded on stations 4 and 6 or 3 and 7.




                                                                               Single/Pair Option




6.   Set the desired release interval distance if more than one bomb is to be released. (OSB 9)
     The timing between release pulses is computed by the aircraft to space multiple weapons in a ‘stick’
     along the ground at the specified distance. Valid distances range from 10-999 feet. This setting has no
     effect if only one bomb or one pair of bombs is released.
                                                                              Interval Distance




     Type in the new impact spacing distance using the OSBs on the left and right of the display and select
     ENTR. You may correct numbers entered in error by selecting RCL or return to the SMS page without
     making changes by selecting RTN.




                                                                               Impact Spacing Distance




7.   Set the number of release pulses if more than one bomb is to be released. (OSB 10)
     This sets the number of release pulses sent to the weapons stations when the Weapon Release button
     is pressed. For example, a setting of 1 releases only one bomb or pair of bombs at a time while a
     setting of 4 releases four bombs or pairs of bombs at a time. This is commonly known as a ‘ripple
     release’.
                                                                                   Release Pulses




          Type in the desired number of release pulses using the OSBs on the left and right of the display and
          select ENTR. You may correct numbers entered in error by selecting RCL or return to the SMS page
          without making changes by selecting RTN.




                                                                                    Release Pulses




Unguided Bombs CCIP Attack
The Continuously Computed Impact Point (CCIP) mode is a computed visual delivery mode with manual weapon
release. This mode allows a high degree of flexibility since the point on the ground at which the weapon will
impact is continuously indicated by a CCIP Pipper on the HUD. No target designation is required. Place the thing
on the thing and drop the bomb.
Summary
      1.     Select A-G Master Mode [2]
      2.     Set Master Arm Switch to Arm
      3.     Set Laser Arm Switch to Arm if laser ranging updates are desired
      4.     Select Bombs and desired options on SMS MFD
      5.     Fly the Pipper onto the target
      6.     Depress the Weapons Release button [RAlt]+[Space] to expend weapons

 1.        Verify CCIP symbology is displayed in the HUD.
           If the CCIP impact point does not lay within the HUD field of view, the Time Delay Cue (TDC) is shown
           as a short, horizonal line on the Bomb Fall Line. The CCIP Pipper is outside the HUD field of view when
           this is displayed. A second, ‘post-designate CCIP’ technique may be used in this situation but that will
           be covered in the next section.




                                                                                      Flight Path Marker




                                                                                      Bomb Fall Line
                                                                                      Marker

               Time Delay Cue
                                                                                      Pull-Up Anticipation Cue

             Master Arm Status

            CCIP Sub-mode                                                             Slant Range



                  CCIP Pipper




 2.        Maneuver your aircraft to position the CCIP Pipper on target.
           When the TDC is no longer displayed on the Bomb Fall Line, the pipper is in the HUD field of view.
           That will be the impact point if the bombs are released immediately.
           One technique is to place the FPM ahead of the target and the pipper just short of the target. Fly the
           Bomb Fall Line over the target and allow the pipper to track straight up the line. This will happen
           naturally as slant range decreases.
                                                                                 Flight Path Marker


                                                                                 Pull-Up Anticipation Cue


                                                                                 Bomb Fall Line


                Target




                                                                                 CCIP      Pipper
                                                                                 Marker




     Monitor the Pull-Up Anticipation Cue to ensure it does not go above the Flight Path Marker. The Pull-
     Up Anticipation Cue (PUAC) provides a visual representation of the altitude required for the bomb fuze
     to arm or altitude to initiate a pull-up to avoid impacting the ground, whichever is more immediate. It
     moves up toward the Flight Path Marker (FPM) as the aircraft loses altitude. Releasing a bomb with the
     FPM below the PUAC will not give the bomb time to arm and result in a dud.
     Laser ranging may be performed to improve the computed firing solution if a targeting pod is installed.
     (See Laser Ranging for more information.)
3.   Press the Weapon Release button to release the bombs when the CCIP pipper is over the
     target.
     The pipper will be at the center of the ‘stick’ if more than one bomb is released in a ripple delivery.
     Hold the Weapons Release button long enough to ensure all weapons come off. The FPM flashes after
     weapons are released.




               Target
                                                                                 CCIP      Pipper
                                                                                 Marker
          Pull up immediately and take evasive action to avoid flying into bomb fragments and to avoid enemy
          fire.


Unguided Bombs CCIP Attack (Post-Designate)
An additional option for CCIP bombs delivery is available for situations where the target cannot be within the
HUD field of view at release. This can sometimes happen on attacks from a shallow dive angle or high altitude.
The steps to enter CCIP mode are the same as described above. The difference is in when you press and hold
the Weapons Release button.
     1.   Maneuver your aircraft to position the CCIP Pipper on target.
          When the Time Delay Cue is displayed on the Bomb Fall Line, the pipper is not in the HUD field of view,
          however you will still place the pipper over the intended target.
          You will designate that location as the target by pressing and holding the Weapons Release button.
          The fire control computer will do the rest.




              Time Delay Cue




                                                                                      Bomb Fall Line

                CCIP Pipper

                                                                                      Target




          Laser ranging may be performed to improve the computed firing solution if a targeting pod is installed.
          (See Laser Ranging for more information.)
     2.   Press and HOLD the Weapons Release button.
          The HUD symbology displayed is identical to that used for a CCRP delivery. Keep the Flight Path Marker
          aligned with the Steering Line. This will align your aircraft with the target even though the target will
          be out of sight.
          A Solution Cue is displayed at the top of the Steering Line. It will fall down the line as the range
          decreases and the weapon is about to be released.
           Solution Cue




                                                                              Flight Path Marker
           Steering Line




3.   Keep the Weapons Release button held until after the Solution Cue passes the Flight Path
     Marker.
     Keep flying the Flight Path Marker over the Steering Line as the Sulution Cue continues to track
     downward. The bombs are released when the Steering Cue passes the Flight Path Marker.




            Solution Cue




                                                                               Flight Path Marker
           Steering Line




     Hold the Weapons Release button long enough to ensure all weapons come off. The FPM flashes after
     weapons are released. Pull up immediately and take evasive action to avoid flying into bomb fragments
     and to avoid enemy fire.
Unguided Bombs CCRP Attack
The Continuously Computed Release Point (CCRP) mode provides computed, automatic release of bombs. This
can be done from a dive, but also from wings-level or a nose-high attitude.
This mode requires a target designation point from which to build the bombing solution. Command steering is
provided to the appropriate weapon release point and the weapon will release automatically at the proper time
such that the weapons hit the target.

  Summary
         1.     Select A-G Master Mode [2]
         2.     Set Master Arm Switch to Arm
         3.     Set Laser Arm Switch to Arm if laser ranging updates are desired
         4.     Select Bombs and desired options on SMS MFD
         5.     Set desired steerpoint number or designate target with TGP
         6.     Center FPM on Steering Line
         7.     Depress and hold Weapons Release button [RAlt]+[Space] to expend weapons at computed
                point

    1.        Verify CCRP symbology is displayed in the HUD.
              The fire control system provides a Steering Line (SL) to provide steering to the designated target. By
              placing the Flight Path Marker (FPM) on the SL and holding down the Weapon Release Button, the
              weapon will release at the proper time and account for wind.

              A Solution Cue is displayed at the top of the SL. It will fall down the line as the range decreases and
              the weapons are about to be released.
              When the Target Designator (TD) is outside the HUD field on view as shown above, a Target Locator
              Line (TLL) extends from the Gun Cross pointing directly at the target. The relative angle is displayed
              next to the Gun Cross showing the number of degrees in tens between the cross and the target.
    2.        Designate the desired target.
              To calculate a bombing solution in CCRP mode, a target first must be designated. This can be done by:
                   •      Selecting a Steerpoint that was placed at the target location
          •       Designating a target with the Targeting Pod (if installed)
     Updates to the target location may be made by slewing the TD Box in the HUD or slewing the TGP
     crosshairs onto a new position with the RDR CURSOR/ENABLE switch.

     Monitor the Pull-Up Anticipation Cue to ensure it does not go above the Flight Path Marker. The Pull-
     Up Anticipation Cue (PUAC) provides a visual representation of the altitude required for the bomb fuze
     to arm or altitude to initiate a pull-up to avoid impacting the ground, whichever is more immediate. It
     moves up toward the Flight Path Marker (FPM) as the aircraft loses altitude. Releasing a bomb with the
     FPM below the PUAC will not give the bomb time to arm and result in a dud.
     Laser ranging may be performed to improve the computed firing solution if a targeting pod is installed.
     (See Laser Ranging for more information.)
3.   Press and HOLD the Weapon Release button.
     Keep the Flight Path Marker aligned with the Steering Line. This will align your aircraft with the target
     even though the target will be out of sight.
     Time to release counts down at the lower right of the HUD.

     When the Solution Cue begins to move down the Steering Line, about 10 seconds prior to release,
     press and hold the Weapon Release button. This provides the fire control computer consent to release
     the weapons.
4.   Keep the Weapons Release button held until after the Solution Cue passes the Flight Path
     Marker.
     Keep flying the Flight Path Marker over the Steering Line as the Sulution Cue continues to track
     downward. The bombs are released when the Steering Cue passes the Flight Path Marker.

     Hold the Weapons Release button long enough to ensure all weapons come off. The FPM flashes after
     weapons are released.
