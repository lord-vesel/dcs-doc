# 2.75-INCH ROCKETS

Aerial rockets pack more punch than the 20mm gun but are still best used as an area suppression weapon. These
come with different warhead options for different purposes including High Explosive (HE), High Explosive Anti-
Tank (HEAT), and Armor Piercing (AP). White Phosphorus (WP) rounds may also be used for incendiary effect or
to mark targets on the ground with their distinctive white smoke.

Target Attack (CCIP)
Upon selection of the A-G master mode, the SMS Air-to-Ground (SMS A-G) page is displayed on the right MFD.
Based on the priority weapon, the information on the SMS A-G page can vary. Follow these steps to achieve the
correct configuration and attack ground targets with rockets in CCIP mode:
    1.        Select the Rockets on the MFD by pressing OSB 6 until rockets are displayed.

                                                                                        and Type


                                                                                        Single/Pair Option




                                                                                        System Status




    2.        Verify CCIP release mode is selected (OSB 2) and set desired Single/Pair option (OSB 8).
              Rockets may be fired with either Single (SGL) or Pair (PAIR) selected. With SGL selected, rockets will
              be fired from only one launcher. With PAIR selected, rockets will be fired from each rocket launcher,
              assuming launchers are loaded on station 3 and 7.

3.   Verify CCIP Rockets symbology is displayed in the HUD.
     CCIP mode is perhaps the most intuitive means to put a weapon on target and mostly involves placing
     the “death dot” of the CCIP pipper over the target and releasing the weapon… put the thing on the
     thing.
     The center of the CCIP pipper represents where the rockets will go assuming the target is within range.
     Line of sight range is indicated by the digital range numeric on the bottom right of the HUD. An In-
     Range Cue will be displayed over the CCIP pipper when slant range is less than 8,000 feet and rockets
     are most effective.

      CCIP Sub-mode




4.   Maneuver your aircraft to position the CCIP pipper on target.
          One technique is to place the pipper just short of the target and allow it to track along the ground until
          it reaches the target. This will happen naturally as slant range decreases. Monitor slant range displayed
          in the bottom right of the HUD and watch for the in-range cue to appear over the pipper.




          Laser ranging may be performed to improve the computed firing solution if a targeting pod is installed.
          (See Laser Ranging for more information.)
     5.   Press the Weapon Release button to fire the rockets when the CCIP pipper is over the
          target and you are within effective range.
          The In-Range Cue is a line over the CCIP pipper that is displayed when slant range is less than 8,000
          feet. In this example, the pipper is on-target and the in-range cue is displayed.




                                                                               In-Range Cue




          When lining up a shot, be careful to avoid target fixation. Target fixation can lead to you not noticing
          an unseen threat or pressing the attack too close. Don’t make yourself an easy target for the machine
          gun on the top of that APC!
Once you have reached the minimum attack range, break off in both the horizontal and vertical to avoid hostile
return fire. You may also wish to release flares in case an infrared-SAM near the enemy target has been launched
at you, but you did not see it.
