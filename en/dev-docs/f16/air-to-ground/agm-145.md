# AGM-154 JOINT STANDOFF WEAPON (JSOW)

JSOW is an inertially-aided glide bomb capable of striking targets up to 70 NM away, depending on the altitude
and speed of launch. When released, the aircraft downloads the target coordinates to the JSOW. The JSOW then
guides to those coordinates. The weapon is completely fire-and-forget. The AGM-154A variant has BLU-97/B
warheads and cannot be re-targeted after launch.

Upper Range Scale. Indicates the top range of the dynamic launch zone (DLZ) in nautical miles.
Current Range. The caret indicates the aircraft’s current range to the target. If the caret is within the in-range
bracket, the weapon can reach the target if released.
In-Range Bracket. Indicates the range where the weapon can reach the target.
Lower Range Scale. Indicates zero range.
Bearing and Distance to Target. Indicates the bearing (degrees) and distance (nautical miles) the current
SPI, which is the location the bomb will fly to after release.

2.   Set desired options on SMS format.
     On the SMS format, configure the weapon as desired.
3.   Set desired steerpoint or designate target
     The weapon will guide to the current sensor point of interest (SPI) when released. If no cursor has
     been added, or Cursor Zero (CZ) has been pressed, the SPI will be the selected steerpoint. Designating
     a target (e.g., using the targeting pod) will shift the SPI to that location.
4.   Center FPM on Steering Line and fly in range
     Steer to place the azimuth steering line (ASL) over the flight path marker. Fly until the range caret is
     within the in-range bracket.

     You must hold the Weapons Release button continuously until the weapon releases. During this
     process, target coordinates and profile data is downloaded to the JSOW. If this process is interrupted
     by releasing the Weapons Release button before the download finishes, the weapon will become a
     hung store and will be unusable.
