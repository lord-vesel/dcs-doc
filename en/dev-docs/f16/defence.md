## RADAR WARNING RECEIVER

The F-16C is equipped with the AN/ALR-56M Advanced Radar Warning Receiver system. The ALR-56M includes
an array of passive radar receiver antennas mounted to the exterior of the airframe, internal signal processors,
a threat warning azimuth indicator, and associated cockpit control panels.


                                                                                             High Band Antennas (2x)

                                                                                                 High Band Antenna




       Dual-Blade Low Band Antenna




                                AN/ALR-56M Advanced RWR Antenna Locations

When radar signals are detected by the external receiver antennas, the signal characteristics are analyzed and
processed by the ALR-56M electronics to determine the specific type of radar that has been detected, what mode
the radar is currently operating within, and its relative bearing from the aircraft. When these characteristics have
been processed, a corresponding symbol is displayed on the Threat Warning Azimuth Indicator and corresponding
audio feedback is provided to the pilot’s helmet.
Antenna coverage of the ALR-56M is 360° in azimuth but only ±45° in elevation. As
a result, the F-16C cannot detect radar signals that are directly above or below the
fuselage centerline. This should be considered when performing defensive
maneuvers at high pitch or roll attitudes, which could result in placing hostile radars
into an RWR blind spot. When this occurs, radar lock and missile launch warnings
will be lost.
When employing the CMDS in Semi-automatic or Automatic modes, this will also                         RWR
cause the ECM pod to cease emitting, which may increase the aircraft’s vulnerability              Blind Spot
to attack for the duration the hostile radar signals are within the RWR blind spot.
It is important to note that the RWR only detects the presence of radar signals; it does not indicate when a threat
radar can see the ownship aircraft, nor does it indicate whether a threat radar is actually tracking the ownship
aircraft or another aircraft along the same general bearing. Prudence should be taken when analyzing the
information the RWR is providing, and weighing that with the other sensors on board your aircraft to produce an
accurate assessment of the tactical situation.
Threat Warning Azimuth Indicator
The Threat Warning Azimuth Indicator is a circular-shaped display mounted in the upper left portion of the
Instrument Panel, with a brightness knob in the top left corner of the display that brightens or dims the display
itself. The Azimuth Indicator is an azimuth-only top-down display with the center of the display representing the
aircraft, and radar threat symbols displayed 360° in azimuth around it. If a threat symbol is displayed at the top
of the display, the associated radar is directly in front of the aircraft. If the threat symbol is displayed at the
bottom of the display, the associated radar is directly behind the aircraft.

The nature of the threat is indicated by the type of symbol, and the relative lethality of the threat is indicated by
the distance from the center of the display at which the threat symbols are positioned. Radar symbols that
represent more lethal threats to the aircraft are shown closer to the center of the display. As a threat radar
progresses from a search/acquisition mode, to target tracking, and then to missile guidance, the symbol will be
incrementally moved toward the center of the display to symbolize its increasing lethality against the aircraft.
    •    Radar in Search/Acquisition mode. The detected radar is operating in a search or target acquisition
         mode, with the symbol positioned along the outside of the display.
    •    Radar in Tracking mode. The detected radar is operating in a target tracking mode, with the symbol
         positioned just outside the solid white circle and enhanced by a box.
    •    Radar in Missile Guidance mode. The detected radar is operating in a missile guidance mode, with
         the symbol positioned inside the solid white circle and further enhanced by a flashing circle.
    •    Airborne Radar. Detected radars that correspond with airborne platforms, such as a fighter or other
         aircraft, are enhanced with a chevron over the symbol.
    •    Highest Priority Radar Threat. The radar threat that is determined to be the highest priority threat
         is enhanced by a diamond. The highest priority threat is continuously evaluated, which may cause the
         diamond to be reassigned to a different threat based on detected radar activity and relative lethality.
When performing defensive maneuvers, the symbols that are closer to the center of the display (especially those
that are actively engaging the aircraft) should take priority consideration over those along the outer area.
A complete list of all RWR symbols and their corresponding threat systems can be found in Appendix B.
When a new threat is detected, an audio tone will be played over the THREAT audio channel, which can be
adjusted on the AUDIO 1 control panel. Additionally, distinctive audio tones are played to indicate to the pilot
when a radar is detected in track or missile guidance modes.

COUNTERMEASURES DISPENSING SET
The F-16C is equipped with the AN/ALE-47 Airborne Countermeasures Dispensing Set (CMDS) for protection
against radar-guided and infrared-guided threats. The ALE-47 includes four expendable countermeasure
dispensers mounted to the exterior of the airframe, internal processors, and a control panel within the cockpit.
The cockpit-mounted CMDS control panel allows the pilot to review expendable countermeasure quantities,
configure CMDS modes of operation, and manage individual countermeasure programs.

CMDS OTHER1 & OTHER2 DED Pages
The CMDS OTHER1 and OTHER2 DED pages have no function. Chaff and flares are the only expendable
countermeasures utilized by the F-16C variant that is simulated by DCS: F-16C Viper.




Momentarily setting the ICP DCS switch to the SEQ position will cycle through these pages back to the CMDS
BINGO DED page.
ELECTRONIC COUNTERMEASURES
Electronic countermeasures (or ECM) pods can be carried to provide an additional layer of protection against
radar threats such as surface-to-air missile (SAM) batteries. Depending on the sophistication and range of the
radar system that is attempting to acquire and track the aircraft, ECM pods can be used to deny, degrade or
delay an attack so that the pilot can escape the engagement envelope of the threat system, evade incoming
weapons, or gain additional time to execute their mission before being forced to take evasive maneuvers.




                                                  AN/ALQ-184 ECM pod




The F-16C can be equipped with either the AN/ALQ-131 or AN/ALQ-184 electronic countermeasures pods.


Radar Jamming
A radar system relies on its ability to receive reflections of its own radio signals off an object, and that these
reflections (called “radar returns”) are strong enough to be processed among other noise and clutter within the
electromagnetic environment. Radar jamming is a type of electronic attack that intentionally radiates radio signals
back to a radar system in order to confuse or degrade the radar’s ability to calculate range and position using its
own radar signals. By matching the victim radar’s signal characteristics, a radar jammer can effectively send false
information into the victim radar. This can be done using “noise jamming” or “deception jamming”.


   Object detected by radar                                                          Transmitted radar signals


                           Reflected radar return is
                       processed as position and range




                                                         Radar Detection
Noise Jamming
Noise jamming is accomplished by saturating a victim radar with radio signals that match the frequencies
transmitted by its own radar antenna. This is primarily performed to deny ranging data by interfering with the
radar’s ability to accurately measure the elapsed time between transmissions and reflected radar energy.



      Aircraft emitting                                                             Transmitted radar signals
    matching radar signals



                     True radar return is masked within a
                  continuous stream of radar energy, denying
                     range information to the victim radar




                                                         Noise Jamming

Unfortunately, since noise jamming relies upon the continuous transmission of high-power radio signals, often
across multiple frequencies (known as “barrage jamming”), it can also highlight the presence of the aircraft to
hostile radar systems before the aircraft itself would have been detected.


Deception Jamming
Deception jamming is accomplished by analyzing a radar signal, and then retransmitting a signal that precisely
matches the signal characteristics in order to generate false targeting information. In contrast to noise jamming,
deception jamming can either produce false target returns or introduce errors into automatic target tracking
techniques within certain radar systems.



       Aircraft emitting                                                             Transmitted radar signals
     matching radar signals


                       True radar return is masked by a
                    stronger radio signal retransmitted to
                   create erroneous range or position data




                                                      Deception Jamming

The advantage of deception jamming is that the jammer itself can be employed intermittently so as to avoid
highlighting the position of the aircraft until necessary. However, depending on the specific radar system, the
effectiveness of these jamming techniques may vary.
Burnthrough
“Burnthrough” may occur when the radar
return of the aircraft is strong enough that
it exceeds the power of the jammer’s radio                Aircraft emitting
                                                                                                       Transmitted radar signals
                                                        matching radar signals
signal when received by the victim radar.
Burnthrough commonly occurs when the
aircraft is at closer ranges to the victim
                                                                       True radar return is strong
radar, which will produce a stronger radar                              enough to overcome the
return. As such, the range at which                                  signal strength of the jammer
burnthrough occurs will vary between
different types of radar systems.
                                                                   Radar “Burnthrough” of Jamming Signals




Application of Electronic Countermeasures
Although ECM does not provide a guarantee against enemy air defenses, when properly employed during a
mission ECM can provide additional time to determine the best way to counter enemy air defenses, or allow an
attack aircraft to sufficiently reduce their range to target in order to employ their own weapons.
