# PROCEDURES

## AIRCRAFT START

The F-16 is designed to be started without ground support equipment and can be airborne within minutes.
Although it can be operated off external power sources during extended ground operations or maintenance
procedures, it is not necessary.

After performing a walkaround, the pilot climbs into the cockpit, secures seat restraints, oxygen supply hoses,
and communications leads. Initial electrical system checks are conducted and the pilot initiates a start of the Jet
Fuel Starter (JFS). The JFS is a small gas turbine engine that is used to spool the main engine to sufficient speed
prior to introducing fuel into the main engine combustion section. Once the engine RPM has accelerated to 20%
and the SEC light on the Caution Light panel extinguishes, the pilot advances the throttle from OFF to IDLE to
introduce fuel.
Once the engine stabilizes at idle speed and is providing primary electrical power via the main generator, the
pilot initializes the aircraft systems, performs an alignment of the inertial navigation system, and performs
remaining pre-flight checks.
If desired, the DCS: F-16C Viper may be started using an auto-start sequence by pressing [LWin]+[Home]. To
cease the auto-start sequence, press [LWin]+[End].
NOTE: When the auto-start sequence is complete, the following systems will be configured as shown.

TAXI
Once the engine is operating and the INS has been aligned, the aircraft may be taxied to the runway. Although
it is typical to initialize the remaining avionics systems and perform other pre-flight checks prior to taxi, it may
not be possible in a scenario in which the aircraft must be scrambled into the air without delay.
However, even if an immediate takeoff is required, some systems may be initialized or some checks may be
performed during the taxi itself, depending on the distance between the aircraft’s parking location and the active
runway. In such an instance, the priority should be given to those systems that ensure the aircraft is ready to
fight as soon as it is airborne.




When ready to taxi, ensure nosewheel steering is engaged by pressing the Missile Step button
on the Side Stick Controller (SSC), which may be confirmed by the illumination of the “AR NWS”
AR Status light on top of the Instrument Panel to the right of the HUD.
Nosewheel steering gain is proportional to ground speed. As speeds increases, the nosewheel
steering will become less sensitive for a given pedal input. However, due to the F-16’s narrow
landing gear “footprint”, care should be taken when turning on the ground to prevent a roll-
over and impacting either wingtip (or underwing stores), damaging the aircraft. If high-speed
taxi is necessary, the aircraft should be gently braked to a lower speed before turning.
Only small throttle inputs are necessary to begin a taxi roll, and even at IDLE the aircraft may start to roll forward
when operating at low gross weights. Once the desired taxi speed has been reached, retard the throttle back to
IDLE to prevent gradual and excessive acceleration.
NOTE: When starting a mission from parking with the aircraft engine running and systems initialized, the
following systems will be configured as shown.
     •    Nosewheel Steering (NWS) – Disengaged.
     •    ALR-56M Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) – Powered Off.
     •    CMDS MODE Knob – STBY.
     •    HMCS Symbology Knob – OFF.

3.   Altimeter and altitude indications – Set and check.
     Verify altitude displayed on the HUD matches the                                           8
     altitude on the altimeter.
                                                                                                10
     •    Check that the altimeter readings in ELEC and
          PNEU are ±75 feet of a known elevation and
          are ±75 feet of one another.                                                  3

     to idle after desired speed is reached.
8.   Brakes and NWS – Check.
     Press the Missile Step button on the SSC to engage
     nosewheel steering (NWS). The lAR/NWSl AR status light to the right of the HUD should illuminate.
     Gently test the brakes and nosewheel steering immediately after the aircraft begins to move forward. Heat
     may build up quickly if brakes are used for an extended period so do not ride the brakes to control taxi
     speed. Use one firm application of the toe brakes to slow the aircraft.
9.   Heading – Check.
10. Flight instruments – Check for proper operation. Verify aircraft heading updates as the aircraft turns and
    that all instruments behave as expected.
TAKEOFF
The F-16C’s powerful F110-GE-129 engine affords the aircraft impressive acceleration at takeoff for its size. Even
when heavily loaded, the F-16C can accelerate quite rapidly when the afterburner is fully engaged. As a result, it
is critical that the pilot ensures the landing gear is fully retracted and the landing gear doors are closed prior to
exceeding 300 knots. This prevents wiring or other landing gear components from becoming detached or causing
damage to the landing gear doors.




A series of final checks are made just prior to entering the runway, to ensure the aircraft is properly configured
for flight, the ejection seat is armed, and to perform one final check for malfunctions within the flight controls.
Some airfields have arm/de-arm areas near the runway (often called
                                                                                                Final checks may be
“EOR” or “End of Runway” areas) that may be used to keep the
                                                                                              performed in designated
taxiway clear for other traffic. These checks may also be performed                           areas near the runways
while on the taxiway, in queue for takeoff.
Once aligned on the active runway, the brakes are applied and the
throttle is advanced no further than 90% RPM. This allows the pilot to
perform a final scan of the engine instruments to verify the engine is
operating as expected; a critical check for a single-engine fighter prior
to takeoff. Once this brief check is complete, the brakes are released
and the throttle advanced to either MIL or AB.
When departing as a flight, each aircraft takes off one at a time, in
short intervals, and then rejoins once airborne.
NOTE: When starting a mission on the runway for takeoff, the following systems will be configured as shown.
     •    Nosewheel Steering (NWS) – Disengaged.
     •    ALR-56M Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) – Powered Off.
     •    CMDS MODE Knob – STBY.
     •    HMCS Symbology Knob – OFF.
Before Takeoff
Prior to entering the runway for takeoff, perform the
following.
1.   ALT FLAPS switch – Verify NORM.
2.   Trim – Check.
                                                                                      6        6
     •    Pitch and yaw trim – Centered
     •    Roll trim - As required
     This is a final verification the trim settings are
     correct for takeoff and have not been inadvertently
     changed.
                                                                                                        7
3.   ENG CONT switch – Verify PRI (guard down).                                            8

4.   Speedbrakes – Verify closed.                                      9
                                                                                12

5.   Canopy – Verify closed and locked.                            5

     •    Verify lCANOPY UNLOCKEDl caution light is
          not illuminated.                                             3
6.   IFF – Set and check. (N/I)
                                                                       13
7.   External fuel tanks – Verify feeding.
                                                                                                      10
     Wing external fuel tanks should feed first and have               6
     a lower quantity than at engine start. The internal
     wing tanks should be full.                                1            2

     If three external tanks are installed, verify that the
     centerline tank is feeding.                              11

8.   FUEL QTY SEL knob – NORM.
     The FUEL QTY SEL knob must be set to the NORM position to allow the automatic forward fuel transfer
     system, trapped fuel warning, and for the BINGO fuel warning computation to be based on fuselage fuel.
9.   STORES CONFIG switch – As required.
     •    CAT I: Air to Air loadouts without external wing tanks.
     •    CAT III: Air to Ground loadouts, or any loadout with external wing tanks.
10. OXYGEN SUPPLY lever – PBG (if high-G maneuvers are expected immediately following takeoff).
11. PROBE HEAT switch – PROBE HEAT.
     This should be done at least two minutes prior to takeoff if icing conditions exist. Manual activation of probe
     heat on the ground when icing is not expected may cause overheat and damage to probe components.
     Probe heat is automatically active once airborne.
12. Ejection safety lever – Down (Armed).
     This arms the ejection seat and allows ejection when the ejection handle is pulled. This is delayed for as
     long as possible to prevent inadvertent ejection on the ground. Egress through other means is usually
     preferable.
13. Flight controls – Cycle. This is to verify freedom of
    movement and ensure controls are not obstructed.
14. Engine OIL pressure – 15-65 PSI.
15. Warning and caution lights – Verify no
    unexpected conditions.                                                 15

16. Targeting pod – Stow (if installed).                              14

7.   Pull back on the stick 10 knots below takeoff speed
     for MIL power or 15 knots below takeoff speed for                      3

     AB and establish takeoff attitude (8–12°).(See
     chart below for takeoff speed)
     NOTE: Pulling back on the stick too soon may lead
     to over-rotation, skipping, or wallowing and will
     increase the distance needed to take off.
8.   LG Handle – UP; after a positive rate of climb is
     established. The trailing edge flaps retract at the
     same time as the landing gear and may cause the
     aircraft to settle and scrape the runway when lift is lost.
     NOTE: Ensure landing gear is fully retracted with the gear doors closed before exceeding 300 KCAS.

Crosswind Takeoff
When taking off in a crosswind, the wind acting upon the vertical tail will create a “weathervane” effect, causing
the nose to turn into the wind. This will in turn raise the upwind wing, causing the aircraft to roll away from the
wind direction.
To counter the effects of the crosswind during the takeoff roll:
1.   Apply a slight amount of left/right stick pressure against the wind direction to keep the wings level.
2.   Apply slight rudder input with the wind, or as necessary, to keep the aircraft centered on the runway
     throughout the takeoff roll.
During the rotation to takeoff attitude, smoothly remove the countering rudder input as necessary to allow the
nose to weathervane back into the wind and establish a proper crab angle into the wind. With a proper crab
angle, the Flight Path Marker (FPM) should be aligned down the runway when becoming airborne.

LANDING
Compared to other fighter aircraft, the F-16 can be somewhat difficult to land. Due to its aerodynamics and
narrow “footprint” of its landing gear, maintaining control throughout the final approach, touchdown and
deceleration can be a challenge for inexperienced pilots.
Depending on the type of approach to be flown, weather conditions, and the nature of the airfield and its
operations, a straight-in approach or an overhead break may be flown.




The F-16C relies on the combined effects of aerodynamic drag and main landing gear wheel brakes to decelerate
the aircraft after touchdown. Just prior to contact with the runway, the pilot raises the nose in a “flare” maneuver
to reduce the descent rate as much as possible. This flare maneuver is especially critical when landing with high
gross weights to prevent over-stressing the main landing gear, but it also allows the pilot to maintain a nose-high
attitude after touchdown for aerodynamic braking; instead of slamming the nose gear down onto the runway
following a touchdown with a high descent rate.
This type of landing, in which only the main landing gear
is used during the initial touchdown and roll-out, is called
a “two-point” landing. The pilot uses forward/aft stick
inputs to maintain the nose-high attitude, which
generates aerodynamic drag across the underside of the
wings and fuselage to decelerate the aircraft. The nose
is typically lowered around 100 knots to allow the nose
landing gear to contact the ground, after which the
wheel brakes on the main landing gear are used to bring
the aircraft to a stop.
Descent/Before Landing
Prior to committing to the approach, configure the
aircraft for landing:
1.   Fuel – Check quantity/transfer/balance.                           4       3


2.   Landing Light – On.
3.   Altimeter – Set and check.                                                    4

     Verify altitude displayed on the HUD matches the              6                   6
     altitude on the altimeter.

     Check that the altimeter readings in ELECT and
                                                                       4

     ±75 feet of one another.                                                  1

4.   Attitude References – Check.                              2

     Attitude indications for ADI, HUD and SAI should
     agree.
5.   ANTI ICE switch – As required.
6.   Targeting pod – Stow (if installed).
     Targeting Pod is stowed by selecting OVRD or
     STBY on the Targeting Pod Control Page.               1

     This is done prior to takeoff and before landing to                                       5

     prevent foreign object damage to components.
Overhead Break
The overhead break is a type of visual approach pattern used by military pilots to expedite landing procedures in
an efficient manner. These landings expedite the approach into an airfield by using a 180° turn at a low throttle
setting to rapidly deplete airspeed and can also be used to rapidly generate precise timing intervals between
wingmen when a formation of aircraft is coming in for landing.

                                             Overhead Break Pattern

1.   Initial Approach. Upon initial approach to the airfield, align the aircraft with the landing runway at 1,500
     feet above ground level (AGL) and 300 knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS). When aligned with the runway,
     note the current aircraft heading on the HUD and calculate the reciprocal heading; this will be the heading
     for the downwind leg following the turn into the level break.
     As the intended landing area comes into view, it is recommended to visually identify one or multiple distinct
     reference points in the airfield environment that are adjacent to the intended touchdown point. The turn
     into the level break is normally initiated when directly over the intended touchdown point, but as this location
     will be directly below the aircraft and cannot be seen from within the cockpit, visual reference points directly
     abeam the touchdown location will allow the pilot to determine when the aircraft is indeed over the
     touchdown point. (see figure on the following page)
     Alternatively, if no visual reference points are available, the level break could be initiated once overhead the
     center of the airfield, or simply executed based on the pilot’s judgement of when it is appropriate to do so.

                                          Visual reference points during initial approach

2.      Level Break. When the aircraft is overhead the touchdown point, roll the aircraft to approximately 70° of
        bank into the intended break direction, set throttle to about 80% RPM, and open the speedbrakes. Pull into
        the break at approximately 3 G. Adjust the attitude as necessary to keep the Flight Path Marker (FPM) on
        the HUD aligned with the Horizon Line to maintain a level altitude throughout the turn.
3.      Downwind Leg. Roll out on the downwind leg opposite the landing heading between 200-220 KCAS and
        1,500 feet AGL. Extend the landing gear and confirm three green WHEELS down lights are illuminated.
        Reduce speed as required to prevent excessive airspeed buildup in the base turn and trim to an Angle-of-
        Attack (AoA) of 11°.
4.      Base Turn. Initiate the base turn when abeam the intended point to rollout on final. This may be estimated
        by viewing the wingtip from the cockpit. Once the wingtip is at the end of the runway, lower the nose slightly
        so the FPM is between the -2.5° and -5° pitch ladder markers, enter a 30-45° bank angle and fly the turn
        at approximately 11° AoA, which will be toward the top of the AoA Bracket symbol.




                                                                                Wingtip has passed beyond
                                                                                  the end of the runway




                                            Wingtip reference for initiating base turn
5.   Final Turn. Use the throttle to control airspeed while using the Side Stick Controller to maintain the AoA at
     approximately 11-13° through the turn from base to final. Maintain a bank angle between 30-45°, or as
     necessary to ensure the aircraft is aligned with the runway upon roll-out.

6.   Rollout on Final. Roll out on final and adjust the controls to achieve the desired glide path and maintain
     the appropriate AoA. The intent is to roll out of the turn aligned with the runway, approximately one nautical
     mile from the touchdown point and 300 feet AGL. Align the HUD Flight Path Marker (FPM) and 2.5° pitch
     ladder with the runway threshold to ensure proper glide path while maintaining 11-13° AoA.

     If desired, the MAN RNG/UNCAGE knob may be depressed to the Un-cage position to declutter the lower
     portion of the HUD. When this occurs, the Heading Tape will be repositioned to the top portion of the HUD
     and the Roll Indicator will be removed (as will the ILS indicators if in use).
7.   Short Final. See Landing procedure on the following page.
Landing
1.   Rollout on Final. Align the HUD Flight Path Marker (FPM) and 2.5° pitch ladder markers with the runway
     threshold to ensure proper glide path while maintaining 11-13° AoA.
     NOTE: If necessary to perform a go-around for another approach and landing attempt, initiate the go-
     around prior to performing the flare over the runway.
     Go-around. Increase throttle, arrest the descent rate, and begin a climb. When a positive rate of climb is
     established, retract the landing gear. Ensure landing gear is fully retracted with the gear doors closed before
     exceeding 300 KCAS. Turn onto crosswind to re-enter the pattern when at the appropriate altitude to do so.
2.   Short Final. When crossing the runway overrun (the portion of the runway before the primary surface
     starts), apply aft pressure on the stick to shift the FPM forward to a point 300-500 feet further down the
     runway. Gently pull back on the stick to flare and reduce the descent rate but do not level off.
3.   Two-Point Touchdown. Retard the throttle to idle and touchdown with a maximum AoA of 13°. An AoA
     greater than 15° during the touchdown or aerodynamic braking may cause the speedbrakes, ventral fins,
     or engine nozzle to contact the runway. Use small inputs to the stick to avoid overcontrolling the aircraft.
4.   Two-Point Aerobraking. Maintain a nose-up attitude (13° maximum) for two-point aerodynamic braking
     until the airspeed has been reduced to approximately 100 knots.
     NOTE: A good reference to use for maximum aerobraking is the Roll Indicator. Adjust the back pressure on
     the stick so that the Horizon Line bisects the lower curve of the Roll Indicator, between the 0° tick mark and
     the pointer.
5.   Three-Point Roll-Out. At approximately 100 knots, reduce back pressure on the stick and lower the
     nosewheel to the runway. Apply moderate to heavy braking to slow the aircraft. After the nosewheel has
     compressed, the speedbrakes may be fully opened and full aft pressure on the stick may be applied for
     maximum braking effectiveness (for short-field landings). Engage nosewheel steering when below 30 knots
     unless it is required earlier to maintain ground track and/or prevent departure from the runway.
                                                                                               Bisect the Roll Indicator with
                                                                                               the Horizon Line between the

                                      Short Final and Landing Roll-out
Crosswind Landing
When landing in a crosswind, the wind acting upon the vertical tail will create a “weathervane” effect, causing
the nose to turn into the wind. During the approach, maintain wings-level and allow the aircraft to crab with the
nose into the wind until touchdown.
At touchdown of the main landing gear, counter the effects of the crosswind during the landing roll-out:
1.   Immediately apply rudder input to remove the crab angle and maintain alignment down the runway, or use
     differential wheel braking as necessary, to keep the aircraft centered on the runway throughout the roll-out.
2.   Apply a slight amount of left/right stick pressure against the wind direction to keep the wings level.
3.   Perform the remainder of the landing roll-out with normal two-point aerobraking until below 100 knots or
     until aircraft control becomes difficult and nosewheel steering is necessary to maintain ground track down
     the runway.
Use caution when engaging nosewheel steering as a strong pedal input may cause an abrupt yaw when nosewheel
steering is engaged. If possible, center the rudder before engaging the nosewheel steering and then gently re-
apply rudder input as necessary to maintain ground track down the runway.


                                                                  Apply rudder to remove crab angle immediately
                                                                   after touchdown, and maintain ground track
                                                                     down the runway during landing roll-out

AIRCRAFT SHUTDOWN
Once the aircraft is safely back on the ground and the flight is to be terminated, an After Landing check is
performed after departing the runway. This configures the aircraft for ground operations and makes the aircraft
safe to approach by ground personnel.
These checks may be configured while taxiing to the parking area or may be performed in designated arm/de-
arm areas immediately after departing the runway (often called “EOR” or “End of Runway” areas).




After arriving at the intended parking location, ground crews place wheel chocks to prevent any un-intended
aircraft movement and the pilot powers down the various avionics and aircraft systems.
Due to its small, lightweight airframe, the F-16 is not equipped with an integrated boarding ladder and relies on
the ground crew to place such equipment next to the cockpit for egress. The pilot secures his or her gear, climbs
out of the cockpit, discusses with the ground crew about any maintenance-related issues encountered during the
flight, and then departs for debriefing while the ground personnel regenerate the aircraft for future sorties.
After Landing
When clear of the runway, perform the following.
1.   PROBE HEAT switch – Verify OFF.
     Manual activation of probe heat on the ground
     when icing is not expected may cause overheat
     and damage to probe components.
2.   ECM Power switch – OFF.

3.   Speedbrakes – Close.
                                                                       8
4.   Ejection Safety Lever – Safe (Up).
     The ejection seat is safed after landing to prevent
     inadvertent ejection. A ground egress is usually
     preferable to ejection in case of an emergency                        7

AERIAL REFUELING
Aerial refueling enables the F-16 and other aircraft to extend their range beyond what may be achieved with
internal fuel or external fuel tanks without landing at an airfield to refuel. Aerial refueling is often critical when
performing trans-oceanic flights, conducting long-range sorties beyond the reach of airbases in friendly or allied
territory, or extending the duration of combat air patrols.




Even if additional fuel is not required to fly to the objective, execute the mission, and return to base, it may be
prudent to perform aerial refueling prior to committing to the objective area. This allows the pilot additional loiter
time over the objective, the option to conduct low-level ingress or egress at higher speeds, more liberal use of
the afterburner in combat, or provide additional options for any contingencies encountered during the mission.
Air-to-Air Refueling (AAR) tracks are areas within which aerial refueling
                                                                                                         Callsign
tanker aircraft, such as the KC-135, will orbit during a mission. These AAR
track locations are normally included within the mission briefing; however,                              Aircraft Type
the F10 map may also be referenced during the mission itself to aid in
                                                                                                         Altitude (MSL)
locating these aircraft (assuming the mission options allow such
information to be displayed on the F10 map). Aerial refueling tankers will
be designated by friendly aircraft icons marked with a “K”.
Alternatively, if an AWACS is on-station, a vector to the nearest tanker
may be requested over the AWACS radio frequency to aid in navigation to
an AAR track.
Approach and Rendezvous
When approaching the AAR track, prior to performing the rendezvous with
the tanker, a radio call should be made to the tanker crew to announce
an intent to refuel. The tanker crew will respond with their current altitude
and airspeed, and whether the receiving aircraft is cleared to the Pre-
Contact position. The receiving aircraft should ensure altitude separation
is established prior to entering the AAR track and visual or radar contact
has been made with the tanker aircraft prior to initiating the rendezvous.
When performing the rendezvous with the tanker, the closure speed and relative altitude should be closely
monitored. The approach should be made from behind and below. There may be other aircraft performing
refueling operations in the vicinity of the tanker, so caution should be exercised to avoid a mid-air collision.
     Approach from behind and               Progressively reduce     Other receiving
     below the tanker’s altitude              the closure rate     aircraft near tanker

7.   HOT MIC/CIPHER switch – HOT MIC.
8.   Exterior Lights – As required. At night, exterior
     lights should be set to DIM and STEADY settings and the Anti-Collision light should be set to OFF.
Pre-contact Position
When cleared to Pre-contact position, the receiving aircraft lines up directly behind the tanker and matches its
speed. The Pre-contact position allows the boom operator to ensure they have positioned the boom for contact,
the refueling system is set to the appropriate transfer rate for the type of aircraft being refueled, and the boom
operator establishes their required visual reference points on the receiving aircraft below them.




                                                                                   “RDY” AR Status light is illuminated




          TOTAL fuel quantity displayed in HUD




As a technique, the BNGO page may be displayed on the DED
(and the HUD if desired), which will display the total fuel in a
cockpit location that is more conducive to maintaining a focus
on the tanker. This precludes the pilot from needing to look
down at the fuel quantity indicator in the cockpit.
(See BNGO DED Page for more information.)
To display the DED page directly on the HUD, set the
DED/PFLD switch to the DED DATA position on the HUD
Control Panel.
Once stable and ready to move in for refueling, the pilot in the receiving aircraft radios to the boom operator that
he/she is established in the Pre-contact position and is ready to move into the contact position.

                                                 Pre-contact Position
Contact Position
Once cleared to the Contact position by the boom operator, use small but smooth control inputs, with very slight
changes to the throttle. After a throttle adjustment, it is prudent to wait several moments to see the effects of
the change before making another.
Allow the boom to pass just left or right of the canopy, about 2 or 3 feet overhead. Continue to move forward
slowly, maintaining lateral alignment with the yellow stripe painted along the underside of the KC-135.
                                                                                               Longitudinal Director Lights




                                                                    Vertical Director Lights




                                                                                                Lateral Centerline Stripe

                                                       Contact Position

Use the director lights along the underside of the tanker’s forward fuselage to establish and maintain the Contact
position. The boom operator will “fly” the refueling boom using the boom-mounted control surfaces to align and
insert the boom into the F-16’s dorsal refueling receptacle.
The lights under the forward fuselage of the KC-135 are directive in nature, meaning they indicate to the pilot
the required corrections that must be made to remain within the ideal Contact position. The left row of lights
indicates vertical alignment, and the right row of lights indicates longitudinal alignment. Green lights indicate a
slight correction and red lights indicate the aircraft is at the limits of the boom’s travel within the Contact position.
•    Arrows that are biased toward the “D” or the “U” indicate a required correction “Down” or “Up”, respectively,
     and are corrected by slight forward/aft pressures on the stick.
•    Dashes that are biased toward the “F” or the “A” indicate a required correction “Forward” or “Aft”,
     respectively, and are corrected by small adjustments of the throttle.

                                          KC-135 Director Light Corrections
When the boom has been seated within the receiving aircraft’s receptacle, the boom operator will announce
“Contact” and confirm positive fuel flow. When this occurs, the “AR NWS” AR Status light illuminates.

        with KC-135 throughout refueling process




                                                                                  “AR NWS” AR Status light is illuminated

           Director lights provide vertical and
     longitudinal alignment within Contact position




           TOTAL fuel quantity displayed in HUD




Once refueling has begun, the receiving aircraft simply needs to maintain the Contact position relative to the KC-
135 and monitor the total fuel quantity. It is not wise to focus on the boom, nor should the pilot’s focus be solely
on the director lights or the cockpit indications for more than a brief moment. A good reference point for
maintaining formation with the KC-135 is the center fuselage along the trailing edge of the main wing roots. This
location is close enough to detect small deviations from the intended position before they become apparent on
the director lights, and the wing roots serve as an immediate attitude indicator of the KC-135 (which is especially
important as the tanker enters or rolls out from a turn within the AAR track). Occasional cross-checks of the
director lights, HUD flight information, total fuel quantity, and the lAR NWSl light should be conducted throughout
the refueling, but the primary focus should remain on the KC-135 itself.
Note that the flying characteristics of the aircraft will subtlety and continuously change as the aircraft takes on
fuel and the gross weight increases. This will cause the aircraft to drop away from the KC-135, requiring a slight
adjustment to the pitch attitude to maintain altitude. This will in turn increase the AoA of the aircraft, which will
require a slight adjustment of the throttle to counter the increase in drag and maintain airspeed.
It is possible to unintentionally disconnect at some point during the refueling process. If this
occurs, the lDISCl AR Status light will illuminate. The pilot may adjust the flight controls to re-
enter the correct alignment within the Contact position, at which the boom operator will repeat
“Contact” and confirm resumption of fuel flow, or the pilot may back away to the Pre-contact
position prior to approaching the Contact position again.
If it is necessary to disconnect from the tanker prior to receiving a full offload, the Missile Step
button may be pressed on the Side Stick Controller, which will disconnect the boom from the
refueling receptacle and illuminate the lDISCl AR Status light.
Once clear of the boom, the aircraft should be slowly backed away to the Pre-contact position while maintaining
alignment directly behind the tanker. Prior to leaving the Pre-contact position, ensure to visually scan the
immediate areas to the left and right of the tanker for other aircraft waiting to refuel, or wingmen waiting for you
to finish before departing from the tanker’s wing.
Breakaway Procedure
At any point during the refueling, if the distance and/or closure rate is such that a potential mid-air collision with
the tanker or the refueling boom is likely, the boom operator will call for an emergency breakaway maneuver by
stating “Breakaway, breakaway.” When an emergency breakaway is commanded, immediately apply forward
pressure on the stick to initiate a descent away from the tanker and retard the throttle to reduce airspeed and
gain separation. The maneuver should be deliberate and expeditious in nature, but not necessarily aggressive.




                                              Breakaway Maneuver

After completing a breakaway, the boom operator will clear the receiving aircraft back to the Pre-contact position
prior to resuming the refueling process, if necessary.
