# NAVIGATION

The F-16C primarily navigates by an Inertial Navigation System (INS), which is aided by a Global Positioning
System (GPS) receiver, a Central Air Data Computer (CADC), and a navigation database of steerpoints within the
Modular Mission Computer (MMC). After power is applied to the aircraft, whether it be from the engine-driven
generator or an external power supply, the pilot must initiate an alignment of the INS. Once aligned, the INS will
continuously calculate the aircraft heading, attitude, altitude, and velocity within a 3-dimensional "system
navigation solution", which produces a horizontal navigation position as well as a vertical altitude position.
While in flight, the F-16C receives continuous position updates from GPS satellites for increased reliability and
precision of the INS system navigation solution. However, in the event GPS signals are unreliable or unavailable,
the INS system navigation solution may gradually accumulate small errors over time. In these instances, the INS
may be updated in flight by performing a Position Fix or an Altitude Calibration.

The F-16C also utilizes several external sensors to supply data to the Flight Control Computer (FLCC) and the
Central Air Data Computer (CADC).
•    A nose-mounted pitot probe provides static and total air pressure data to the CADC and FLCC, and drives
     the analog Altimeter and Airspeed/Mach Indicator on the Instrument Panel.
•    A side-mounted air data probe also provides static and total air pressure data to the CADC and FLCC, along
     with angle-of-attack (AOA) and sideslip data.
•    A pair of AOA transmitters on either side of the nose provide proportional AOA data to the FLCC.
•    A pair of static pressure ports on either side of the nose provide differential sideslip data to the FLCC.
•    A total temperature probe along the underside of the right leading-edge extension provides analog
     temperature data to the CADC for computing true airspeed and air density.
During operations in low-visibility conditions, the F-16C is equipped with Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) capability
through its MIDS LVT terminal, Instrument Landing System (ILS) and Marker Beacon radio receivers, and a
Combined Altitude Radar Altimeter (CARA) for precisely measuring the aircraft altitude above ground level (AGL).
