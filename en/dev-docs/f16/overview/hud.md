# HEADS-UP DISPLAY (HUD)

The Heads-Up Display, or HUD, is one of the most important instruments and provides valuable information
regarding aircraft flight performance, navigation, targeting, and visual cues for weapons employment. All
information is displayed on a combining glass mounted in the forward field-of-view at eye level. The display
surface field of view is 25° in diameter and extends down to a line 10.5° below the field-of-view center, with the
symbology focused at infinity and superimposed upon the outside world along the flightpath of the aircraft.

Some elements of the HUD symbology are always present, others will be displayed or removed based on the
selected master mode, available sensor(s), or weapon profile; and some elements can be optionally displayed or
removed based on pilot preference. (See HUD Control Panel for more information.)


HUD Symbology Elements
1.   Great Circle Steering Cue. Provides a lateral steering indication to the selected steerpoint. The steering
     cue functions using the great circle method, in that the most direct route across a 3-dimensional sphere is
     used to determine the course to the destination instead of a fixed heading across a 2-dimensional surface.
     The line extending from the cue indicates the relative bearing of the selected steerpoint from the nose. If
     the line is pointed to the 12 o’clock, the steerpoint is directly ahead. If the line is pointed to the 3 or 9
     o’clock, the steerpoint is 90 to the right or left respectively. If the line is pointed to the 6 o’clock, the
     steerpoint is behind the aircraft. (See Navigation by Steerpoints for more information.)
2.   Current G. Displays the current aircraft G-load value. The G value is displayed to the nearest tenth of a G,
     and ranges from +9.9 to -9.9 G’s.
3.   Diamond Symbol. Displays the 3-dimensional position of the selected steerpoint, in both position and
     altitude. When the Diamond Symbol is out of the HUD field-of-view an X is superimposed across the symbol.
     (See Navigation by Steerpoints for more information.)
4.   Horizon Line. The Horizon Line is an element of the Attitude Bars that indicates 0° pitch, relative to the
     Boresight Cross.
5.   Velocity & Velocity Scale. Velocity is displayed in knots, between 60 to 900 knots CAS. When below 60
     knots CAS, the HUD will display 0 knots. Each major tick mark on the Velocity Scale represents 50 knots and
     is accompanied by a 2-digit label, and each minor tick mark represents 10 knots.
     The Velocity may be set to calibrated airspeed (CAS), true airspeed (TAS), or ground speed (GND SPD)
     using the Velocity Switch on the HUD Control Panel. A “C” is displayed to the right of the Velocity Scale
     when set to calibrated airspeed, a “T” is displayed when set to true airspeed, and a “G” is displayed when
     set to ground speed. The Velocity Scale will automatically revert to calibrated airspeed if in Dogfight mode
     or if the landing gear is deployed.
6.   Master Arm Status. Displays the position of the MASTER ARM Switch on the MISC panel.
     •    ARM. The MASTER ARM Switch is in the MASTER ARM position.
     •    (Blank). No text is displayed if the MASTER ARM Switch is in the OFF position.
     •    SIM. The MASTER ARM Switch is in the SIMULATE position.
7.   Mach Number. Displays the current Mach number to the hundredths value.
8.   Maximum G. Displays the maximum G-loading measured during the flight. This value may be reset to 1.0
     by momentarily placing the Drift Cut-Out/Warning Reset switch on the ICP to the WARN RESET position.

10. Ownship Bearing & Distance from Bullseye. Displays the azimuth and distance as measured from the
    Bullseye location to the aircraft.
     The Ownship Bearing & Distance from Bullseye can be toggles using the BULL DED page.
11. Attitude Bars. A series of horizontal bars
12. (including the Horizon Line) spaced at 5° intervals to indicate aircraft pitch attitude, relative to the Boresight
    Cross. At pitch angles greater than 60, the attitude bar intervals are spaced at 10 intervals. Positive pitch
    angles are indicated by a solid attitude bar, and negative pitch angles are indicated by a dashed bar. Each
    bar includes a small line along the outside pointing toward the Horizon Line.
     The Attitude Bars are caged to the Flight Path Marker in azimuth, which may occur in high crosswinds or
     lateral drift. The Drift Cut-Out/Warning Reset switch on the ICP can be used to cage the Attitude Bars and
     FPM to the center of the HUD when set to the DRIFT C/O position.
13. Boresight Cross. The Boresight Cross is displayed in all master modes and represents the fuselage
    reference line.
14. Flight Path Marker. The Flight Path Marker (FPM) consists of a circle with three lines extending outward
    from the circumference at the 12, 3, and 9 o’clock positions. The FPM indicates the aircraft inertial velocity
    vector.
     When the FPM is out of the HUD field-of-view, which may occur in high crosswinds, lateral drift or high
     angles-of-attack, an X is superimposed across the symbol. The Drift Cut-Out/Warning Reset switch on the
     ICP can be used to cage the Attitude Bars and FPM to the center of the HUD when set to the DRIFT C/O
     position.
     When in Air-to-Ground mode, the FPM will flash when a weapon is released.
15. Altitude & Altitude Scale. The Altitude & Altitude Scale is in feet, to the nearest 10 feet. Each major tick
    mark on the Altitude Scale represents 500 feet and is accompanied by a 2-digit label, and each minor tick
    mark represents 100 feet.
16. Radar Altitude. The Radar Altitude is displayed within a box marked by an “R”, to the nearest 10 feet. If
    the radar altimeter is set to standby or is otherwise not transmitting, the display will be blank.
17. Altitude Low Setting. Displays the current CARA ALOW setting in feet. When the radar altimeter indicates
    an altitude less than this setting, this data field will flash and will be accompanied by an
    “ALTITUDE…ALTITUDE” voice message alert.
18. Slant Range. The Slant Range is the direct, straight-line distance from the aircraft to the current target or
    SPI location. For range values greater than 1.0 NM, the range is displayed as a four-digit value to the nearest
    tenth of a nautical mile (i.e., 15.2 NM is displayed as “015.2”). For range values less than 1.0 NM, the range
    value is displayed as a three-digit value to the nearest hundred feet (i.e., 5500 feet is displayed as “055”).
    The letter on the left of the display indicates the method the range is determined.
     •    B. The slant range is determined based on the barometric altitude and steerpoint elevation.
     •    R. The slant range is determined based on the radar altimeter.
     •    F. The slant range is determined based on ranging data from the FCR.
     •    M. A Manual range is being used in an air-to-air mode or in air-to-ground CCIP mode.
19. Time to Go. Displays the time that is estimated to elapse before arriving at the selected steerpoint, based
    on the current ground speed. (See Navigation by Steerpoints for more information.)
20. Distance to Steerpoint/Steerpoint Number. The distance to the selected steerpoint is displayed to the
    left of the chevron in 1 nautical mile increments. The selected steerpoint number is displayed to the right of
    the chevron. (See Navigation by Steerpoints for more information.)
21. Roll Indicator. The Roll Indicator consists of increment marks at 0°, 10°, 20°, 30° and 45° bank angles.
    As the aircraft rolls in either direction, the caret symbol will rotate along the indicator arc to indicate the
    current bank angle.
22. Heading Scale. The Heading Scale indicates the magnetic heading of the aircraft. A fixed lubber line along
    the top of the scale and a digital readout below the scale displays the magnetic heading. Each major tick
    mark on the tape represents 10° of magnetic heading and is accompanied by a 2-digit label, and each minor
    tick mark represents 5° of magnetic heading.
     When the Velocity Scale is set to ground speed, a triangle symbol is presented along the Heading Scale
     indicating the aircraft’s course track across the ground.
23. Bank Angle Indicator. The Bank Angle Indicator consists of increment marks at 15°, 30°,
    45°, and 60° bank angles. The increment marks are caged to the Flight Path Marker and
    the FPM wings are used as indicators of the bank angle.
     The Bank Angle Indicator is displayed in place of the Roll Indicator and is only displayed in
     NAV master mode and when the Scales Switch is in the VV/VAH position on the HUD Control
     Panel.
24. Vertical Velocity Scale. The Vertical Velocity Scale is displayed to the left of the Altitude
    Scale when in NAV master mode. Each major tick mark on the Vertical Velocity Scale
    represents 1000 feet per minute, and each minor tick mark represents 500 feet per minute.
     The Vertical Velocity Scale is only displayed in NAV master mode and when the Scales
     Switch is in the VV/VAH position on the HUD Control Panel.
25. Manual Bombing Reticle. The Manual Bombing Reticle is displayed using the
    Primary or Secondary reticle patterns. Using the RET DEPR knob on the ICP,
    the reticle can be positioned vertically from 0 to -260 mils with respect to the
    Boresight Cross, and it is fixed horizontally on the HUD center line and not wind-
    corrected.
     •    Primary Reticle. The primary reticle consists of a 2-milliradian dot
          surrounded by a dashed 50-milliradian inner circle and a solid 100-
          milliradian dotted outer circle.                                                 Reticle Depression Setting

     •    Secondary Reticle. The secondary reticle consists of a 2-milliradian dot
          surrounded by dotted 50-milliradian inner circle and a dotted 100-
          milliradian outer circle. Four 6-milliradian tick marks are positioned along
          the outer circle marking the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o’clock locations.
     •    Manual Reticle Depression Setting. Indicates the current reticle
          depression setting of the Manual Bombing Reticle, as set by the RET DEPR
          knob on the ICP.
Additional HUD symbology elements associated with the various sensors and weapons are described in the
applicable chapters of this manual.
HUD Control Panel
The HUD Control Panel provides the pilot with the ability
to tailor which HUD symbology elements are displayed at
any given time to suit the current mission, situation, or
personal preference.
In Navigation master mode, with no targets being tracked
by the FCR, the HUD can be de-cluttered as shown in the
image to the right.
