# COCKPIT OVERVIEW
The F-16’s cockpit layout, avionics, and fire control systems are optimized for operation by a single pilot. Critical
controls that are needed for aerial combat are located on the Hands-On Controls (Side Stick Controller and
Throttle) to provide rapid and seamless control of the radar and weapons during maneuvering flight when moving
one’s arms and hands under various G forces may be difficult.
Essential information is displayed on the Heads-Up Display (HUD), the two Multi-Function Displays (MFD), and
the Data Entry Display (DED). Panels that contain functions that are not typically needed after start-up are
concentrated on the right console, with mission-related equipment or functions that may be used throughout the
flight are concentrated on the left console for use by the throttle hand.

                                                           Hands-On Controls




It is important to have a general understanding of where the various controls
are located. To help locate items more easily, the cockpit has been delineated                       1
into five primary areas: Left Console, the Left Auxiliary Console, the
Instrument Panel, the Right Auxiliary Console, and the Right
Console.
Each text box above may be selected to jump to a more detailed description
of that instrument panel or console, to include the Hands-On Controls and
Ejection Seat Controls. Selecting the image of the instrument panel or
console will return the manual back to this page.
Throughout this manual, a cockpit diagram (as shown at right) may be used
to identify specific cockpit components that are used to perform procedures
such as start-up, takeoff, navigation, or landing. The component location that
is applicable to the step within the procedure will be marked with the
corresponding number of the checklist or procedure item to assist the player
in rapidly locating it. In the example to the right, the Heads-Up Display (HUD)
is marked as step 1.

1.   Attitude Sphere. Rotates within the ADI to indicate pitch and roll attitude throughout all orientations of
     flight, in relation to the Aircraft Symbol. The light blue hemisphere indicates the aircraft nose is pointed
     above the horizon toward the sky, in a climb. The dark brown hemisphere indicates the aircraft nose is
     pointed below the horizon toward the ground, in a dive.
2.   Upper Bank Angle Indicator. Indicates bank angle relative to the horizon. When the indicator is aligned
     with the fixed outside bank angle index, the aircraft is in a level attitude.
3.   Pitch Scale. Provides an attitude reference scale of aircraft pitch in relation to the Aircraft Symbol. Major
     tick marks are placed at every 10° of pitch and minor tick marks are placed at every 5° of pitch.
4.   Glideslope Deviation Indicator. Indicates the relative position of the glideslope along the Glideslope
     Deviation Scale when performing an ILS approach. If the indicator is aligned with the center tick mark, the
     aircraft is on glideslope.
5.   Glideslope Deviation Scale. Provides a vertical reference of relative aircraft position above or below the
     glideslope when tuned to an ILS approach frequency and roughly aligned with the approach path for the
     associated landing area. Each white dot corresponds with a 2.5° vertical separation from the glideslope. If
     the Glideslope Indicator is aligned with the top or bottom white dot of the Glideslope Deviation Scale, the
     aircraft is 5° above or 5° below the glideslope, respectively. (See ILS Navigation for more information.)
6.   Aircraft Symbol (Waterline). Provides a fixed attitude reference of the aircraft nose around which the
     Attitude Sphere rotates. The vertical alignment of the symbol can be manually adjusted using the Pitch Trim
     knob.
7.   OFF Warning Flag. Indicates the ADI is not receiving aircraft attitude data from the INS, which may be
     caused by a failure of the ADI itself, a failure of the INS, or if the INS is powered OFF.
8.   AUX Warning Flag. Indicates the ADI is receiving degraded attitude data from the INS, which may be
     caused by a malfunction of the INS or a failure to achieve a coarse alignment.
9.   Lower Bank Angle Scale. Indicates the bank angle when used in conjunction with the Lower Bank Angle
     Indicator. A white triangular bank angle index is set at 0° of bank. Major tick marks are placed at 30°, 60°
     and 90° angles of bank. Minor tick marks are placed at 10° and 20° angles of bank.
10. Lower Bank Angle Indicator. Indicates bank angle relative to the horizon. When the indicator is aligned
    with the fixed outside bank angle index, the aircraft is in a level attitude.
11. Slip Indicator (Ball). Indicates whether the aircraft is in coordinated flight. With the ball centered between
    the two black marks, the aircraft is in coordinated flight, which minimizes drag. When performing a
    “coordinated turn” with the ball kept in the center of the slip indicator, the centripetal force of the turn is
    maintained in alignment with the bottom of the aircraft, and no lateral acceleration is experienced by the
    pilot. If the ball slides to one side in the same direction of a bank, the aircraft is in a non-coordinated
    “slipping turn”. If the ball slides to one side in the opposite direction of a bank, the aircraft is in a non-
    coordinated “skidding turn”.
12. Rate of Turn Indicator. Indicates the aircraft rate of turn, with the lower white bar moving left and right
    to indicate an increased turn rate in that direction. One bar width equates to 1° to 1.2° per second turn
    rate. If the lower white bar is aligned with the upper white bar in the center, the aircraft is not turning. If
    the lower white bar is aligned with the upper white bars on the left or right, the aircraft is in a standard rate,
    3° per second turn. If the lower white bar is centered between two of the upper white bars, the aircraft is
    in a half standard rate turn.
13. Pitch Trim Knob. Used to adjust the relative pitch of the Attitude Sphere in relation to the Aircraft Symbol.
    If the knob arrow is aligned with the white dot on the face of the ADI, the ADI pitch trim is at zero. Each
    click of rotation of the knob will adjust the pitch trim ±0.5°.

            10. HORN SILENCER Button


     12. SPEED BRAKE Position Indicator
1.   EMER STORES JETTISON Button. When pressed for one full second, this button will apply power to the
     Stores Management System (SMS) and initiate a jettison sequence of all external fuel tanks, carted
     suspension racks, and free fall ordnance loaded on stations 3 through 7. Air-to-air missiles will not be
     jettisoned, nor their missile launchers. There is no requirement for the aircraft to be armed. If the aircraft
     is on the ground with weight-on-wheels, the GND JETT ENABLE switch is required to initiate the emergency
     jettison sequence.
2.   HOOK Switch. This switch extends the hook for emergency arrestment on airfields equipped with an
     arrestment system. However, once the hook is dropped, it cannot be fully retracted from the cockpit.
     •    UP. Commands the pneumatic pressure holding the hook extended to release, allowing the hook to be
          raised over runway arresting wires to taxi clear.
     •    DN. Commands the hook to be released from its stowed position and held to its full extension using
          pneumatic pressure.
3.   WHEELS Down Lights. These show the state of the main landing gear and nosewheel. When green, the
     respective landing gear is down and locked.
4.   LG Handle. Movement of the handle operates electrical switches to command landing gear retraction or
     extension. A warning light in the LG handle illuminates when the gear and doors are in transit or have failed
     to lock in the commanded position. The LG handle warning light also illuminates when the TO/LDG CONFIG
     warning light illuminates on the right eyebrow lights panel.
5.   GND JETT ENABLE Switch. Used by maintenance personnel for checkout and testing of aircraft armament
     systems.
     •    ENABLE. All arming and release conditions are permitted, regardless of landing gear or weight-on-
          wheels conditions.
     •    OFF. When the landing gear are down and the aircraft has weight-on-wheels emergency jettison,
          selective jettison, and normal weapons release functions are inhibited. When the landing gear is down,
          selective jettison and normal weapons release functions are inhibited.

     landing gear braking action. This switch is normally kept in the CHAN 1 position.
7.   ANTI-SKID Switch. Controls the anti-skid and parking brake functions of the wheel brakes.
     •    PARKING BRAKE. Applies full brake pressure to each main landing gear brakes when weight-on-
          wheels and the throttle is in the OFF or IDLE positions. If the throttle is advanced 1 inch beyond IDLE,
          the switch will automatically be spring-loaded to the ANTI-SKID position and the parking brake will be
          disengaged. Can be used as an emergency brake in case of a toe brake failure.
     •    ANTI-SKID. Available any time the toe brakes are powered. When the toe brakes are applied to less
          than 85%, the anti-skid system provides deceleration skid control. When the toe brakes are applied at
          85% or greater, the anti-skid system provides maximum performance skid control.
     •    OFF. Anti-skid and parking brake functions are disabled.
8.   DN LOCK REL Button. Mechanically unlocks the spring-actuated lock that holds the LG handle in place,
     should the associated electrical solenoid fail or not be powered. It also overrides the weight-on-wheels signal
     and allows the landing gear to be retracted while on the ground if the LG handle is raised.
9.   STORES CONFIG Switch. Adjusts FLCS based on stores configuration. When set to CAT III the FLCS limits
     the angle of attack and onset rates in order to increase departure resistance. This switch has no effect when
     the FLCS gains are set to takeoff/landing configuration (landing gear deployed or air refueling door open).
     •    CAT I. Used for air-to-air loadouts without external wing tanks.
     •    CAT III. Used for air-to-ground loadouts or when equipped with external wing tanks.

Magnetic Compass
The magnetic compass is a self-contained indicator which shows the heading of the
aircraft in relation to magnetic north.




Fuel Quantity Indicator
The FUEL Quantity Indicator displays total remaining fuel in all tanks via the totalizer
numerical readout in pounds (lbs) of fuel. Two analog needles indicate fuel in Aft and
Left (AL) and Forward and Right (FR) tanks in 100-pound increments.
The FUEL QTY SEL knob can be used to change which internal or external fuel tanks
the analog needles are referencing to display calculated fuel quantity.
If the two needles become too divergent, indicating a fuel imbalance, red will be shown
at the base of a needle. In such a case, the ENGINE FEED knob on the FUEL Control
Panel can be used to correct the imbalance.
Pilot Fault List Display (PFLD)
The Pilot Fault List Display, or PFLD, lists all FLCS detected faults.
Two types of PFLDs are displayed: WARNING level and CAUTION
level. Warnings are associated with the FLCS and have a bracket
around them. Cautions are associated with other FLCS elements,
engine, and avionics systems.
When a PFLD item is displayed, its corresponding caution light
indicator will illuminate, and the MASTER CAUTION light will be lit. To clear a PFLD fault, the fault acknowledge
(F-ACK) button is pressed.


Caution Light Panel
The Caution Light panel consists of multiple indicator lights associated with possible detected fault conditions.




FLCS FAULT. A dual malfunction has occurred in the Flight Control Computer (FLCC) electronics, the leading-
edge flaps (LEF) are locked, or the FLCS BIT has failed.

Manual Pitch Override Switch
In case of a deep stall departure, the Manual Pitch Override (MPO) switch allows the
pilot to command greater authority from the horizontal stabilators to reinforce pitch
oscillations until sufficient pitch rates are present for recovery into controlled flight. The
guards on either side of the switch allow the pilot to better grip the switch in case of
an inverted departure when hanging upside down from the seat straps.
     •     NORM. Normal operation. The switch is spring-loaded to this position.
     •     OVRD. When held to this position, the horizontal stabilator authority is
           increased to assist with recovery. Note that pilot roll and yaw commands from the Side Stick Controller
           (SSC) are inhibited when the switch is held in this position, however the rudder pedals will still retain
           yaw input authority.
ENG & JET START Control Panel
The Engine & Jet Start panel governs the start system for the

     after JFS initiation to indicate the Jet Fuel Starter (JFS)
                                                                          2. JFS Switch
     is operating at its governed speed.
2.   JET FUEL – JFS Switch. The JET FUEL switch uses one
     or both brake/JFS accumulators to drive the hydraulic
     starter motor of the Jet Fuel Starter. The JFS may be          3. ENG CONT Switch
     started even if the MASTER switch on the FUEL control
     panel is set to OFF.
     •    START 1. A single brake/JFS accumulator is used
          to spool up the JFS into operation.
     •    OFF. Turns off the Jet Fuel Starter. During ground         4. AB RESET Switch
          starts, the JFS will automatically switch OFF when
          the engine RPM attains 55%. During in-flight
          restarts the JFS will not automatically shut down
          and must be manually switched to OFF.
     •    START 2. Both brake/JFS accumulators are used to
                                                                   5. MAX POWER Switch

          attempting to restart the engine below 20,000 feet.
3.   ENG CONT Switch. Manually selects the engine control mode.
     •    PRI. Sets engine operation to Primary control mode. This position is used for normal operations, which
          utilizes the Digital Electronic Control (DEC) to manage the functions of the engine and the afterburner.
          The DEC is an electronic computer that controls fuel flow, fan and core speed limiting, turbine
          temperature limiting, pressure ratios, nozzle position, and ensures stable operation throughout all
          altitudes, airspeeds, and maneuvers to prevent compressor stalls or engine damage.
     •    SEC. Sets engine operation to Secondary control mode and illuminates the SEC caution light on the
          Caution Light panel. This system uses only the hydromechanical fuel scheduling of the Main Engine
          Control (MEC) in case of a malfunction or failure in the DEC. This mode may be entered automatically
          by the DEC or manually selected by the pilot. When operating in Secondary mode the afterburner will
          be unavailable, the nozzle will be fixed in the closed position, temperature and speed limiting will be
          disabled, and overall thrust will be reduced but the engine will produce higher thrust at idle power.

Canopy Switch & Canopy Handle
The Canopy Switch controls the actuator to raise and
lower the canopy. The Canopy Handle locks/unlocks the          1. Canopy Switch   2. Canopy Lever (Unlocked Position)
canopy and inflates/deflates the canopy pressure seal.
1.   Canopy Switch. Controls the canopy actuator.
     •    Up. When the Canopy Lever is in the unlocked
          position, this position raises the canopy
          actuator to full extension. The switch will
          automatically snap back to the center position
          when the canopy actuator reaches full
          extension.
     •    Center. The canopy actuator stops canopy
          motion.
     •    Down. This position lowers the canopy actuator to full retraction. The switch is spring-loaded to center
          from this position and must be held to lower and close the canopy.
2.   Canopy Lever. Prevents the canopy from un-latching and controls the canopy pressure seal.
     •    Unlocked (open, pulled outward). The canopy pressure seal is deflated, and the CANOPY eyebrow
          warning light illuminates. The Canopy Lever should be placed in this position prior to lowering the
          canopy. The Canopy Lever also physically limits the full travel of the throttle lever.
     •    Locked (closed, up against cockpit wall). The canopy is locked and the pressure seal is inflated.
Canopy Jettison T-Handle
In case of an emergency, the CANOPY JETTISON T-handle provides an
alternate means to separate the canopy from the aircraft. This can be used
if the primary ejection handle is pulled but the canopy fails to separate,
preventing ejection.




DEFOG Lever
The DEFOG lever can be moved forward and back to provide de-fogging to the canopy.
    •    MIN. Most of the airflow is diverted to the vents behind the seat.
    •    MAX. Most of the airflow is diverted to the forward canopy area
         and the air vent at the bottom of the center instrument panel.
              o    When set to the full MAX position with the TEMP knob
                   set to AUTO, the air flow will be set to full warm for 3
                   minutes. Retarding the lever and returning it to MAX will
                   restart this 3-minute period of full warm.

     will be degraded unless “USA” is one of the countries assigned to the player’s coalition within the DCS
     mission. However, these limitations may be overridden if both of the following conditions are true:
     •    Unrestricted SATNAV is enabled in the player’s GAMEPLAY options or is enforced as enabled in the
          Mission Options for the mission being played.
     •    Unrestricted SATNAV is not enforced as disabled in the Mission Options for the mission being played.
7.   DL Switch. Powers the Secure Modem Datalink (SMDL). (N/I)
8.   INS Knob. Sets the operating mode of the Inertial Navigation System (INS) and determines the method of
     alignment when necessary. While the INS is performing an alignment on the ground, it is imperative that
     the aircraft is not moved or repositioned in any way, to include reconfiguring externally mounted equipment
     or arming/re-arming weapons stations. (See INS Alignment for more information.)
     •    OFF. Removes power from the INS. The INS knob should remain in this position on aircraft power for
          a minimum of 10 seconds before moving the INS knob from off or shutting down the aircraft.
     •    ALIGN – STOR HDG. Initiates a Stored Heading Alignment of the INS using previous alignment data
          stored within the MMC. This allows the alignment process to be completed more rapidly than a Normal
          Gyrocompass Alignment but requires that the aircraft not be moved after the INS is powered off
          (assuming the INS had a good alignment prior to the power being removed).
     •    ALIGN – NORM. Initiates a Normal Gyrocompass Alignment of the INS from manually entered position
          data. This alignment mode requires more time to complete but allows the aircraft to regain position
          confidence if the aircraft has been repositioned by ground crews since the last time the INS was
          powered and properly aligned.
     •    NAV. Sets the INS to normal navigation functionality after an alignment has been performed
          successfully.
     •    CAL. No function.
     •    IN FLT ALIGN. Initiates an In-Flight Alignment of the INS but requires the pilot to maintain a stable
          attitude on a constant heading while the alignment proceeds. When the INS knob is initially moved to
          IN FLT ALIGN, the INS will automatically enter Attitude mode until a coarse alignment can be
          completed.
     •    ATT. Attitude mode provides pitch, roll, and heading information only and is used as a degraded mode
          of operation when the situation dictates. No navigational information will be available except TACAN.
9.   MIDS LVT Knob. The Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) knob enables/disables or
     zeroizes the MIDS radio terminal. (See Tactical Net Datalink for more information.)
     •    ZERO. Zeroizes sensitive data within MIDS LVT internal memory.
     •    OFF. Disables power to the MIDS LVT.
     •    ON. Enables power to the MIDS LVT.
VOICE MESSAGE Switch
The Voice Message switch is used to silence all aircraft voice messages when set to INHIBIT. This
is normally only performed when a voice message is repeating in an erroneous manner.




ZEROIZE Switch
In an emergency, the ZEROIZE switch can erase all sensitive data from the systems such as
secure voice encryption, GPS keys, and others.




SEAT ADJ Switch
The Seat Adjustment switch controls an electric
motor that raises or lowers the pilot seat. This                SEAT ADJ Switch
function allows the pilot to ensure their sitting height
corresponds with a comfortable view of the
instrument panel and alignment of their viewpoint
through the HUD. The seat can also be raised during
landing for increased visibility over the nose, if
                                                                NUCLEAR CONSENT Switch
desired.
The switch is spring-loaded to the center “off”
position, and must be held up or down to adjust the
seat height.




NUCLEAR CONSENT Switch
This switch is not implemented.
Ejection Seat Controls

Ejection Handle
The Ejection Handle is pulled to
initiate the ejection sequence in an
emergency where continued flight or
a safe landing is no longer possible
or is in doubt. Pulling the handle
jettisons the canopy, followed by
igniting a rocket motor mounted to
the seat, expelling the seat itself
along with the pilot to descend to the
surface under a parachute.
The ejection handle itself is not
implemented in DCS: F-16C. The                                         Ejection Handle
ejection sequence can be initiated by
pressing [LCtrl]+[E].

in an emergency.
When the handle is placed in the upright position, the ejection seat
is disarmed, and the SEAT NOT ARMED caution light illuminates on
the Caution Light Panel.
When the handle is rotated aft and down so that it is flush with the
ejection seat surface, the ejection seat is armed and the SEAT NOT
ARMED caution light extinguishes.




                                                                                          Ejection Seat Arming
