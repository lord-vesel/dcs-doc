# AUTOPILOT

The F-16’s autopilot provides a “hands-off” flight control capability for reduced pilot workload. When the autopilot
is engaged, the Flight Control Computer (FLCC) electronically commands movement to the flight control servo-
actuators in accordance with the enabled autopilot modes based on data received from the Inertial Navigation
System (INS) and the Central Air Data Computer (CADC).




Depending on the configuration of the autopilot controls (described on the following pages), the autopilot may
be configured to perform the following tasks.
•    Maintain a heading, as set by the pilot.                    •    Maintain the current aircraft altitude.
•    Maintain a direct course to the selected steerpoint,        •    Maintain the current aircraft attitude.
     as set by the pilot or the navigation route.
It is important to note that the autopilot is only intended to reduce pilot
workload, allowing the pilot to focus on other cockpit tasks such as
reviewing kneeboard information, tuning radios, or interacting with
aircraft sensors. The autopilot is not capable of navigating a flight plan,
which includes speed and altitude changes, nor is it capable of precisely         Automatically      Manually sequenced
flying along a navigation route. The pilot must continue to monitor and         sequenced after      by the pilot prior to
                                                                                  overflying the        overflying the

As an example, if steerpoint sequencing has been set to AUTO on the
STPT DED page, the next steerpoint in the route is selected when the
aircraft is within 2 nautical miles of the selected steerpoint and the range
to the selected steerpoint is increasing. If the autopilot is configured to
maintain a direct course to the selected steerpoint, the autopilot will turn
toward the next steerpoint after the selected steerpoint has been
overflown. Alternatively, the pilot may manually sequence to the next            Autopilot steering with AUTO
steerpoint to initiate the turn in advance of the selected steerpoint so            steerpoint sequencing
that the aircraft rolls out of the turn along the navigation route itself.
Autopilot Controls
The autopilot is enabled and configured by the autopilot
switches, along with additional controls within the
cockpit, depending on the selected modes of operation.
1.   Autopilot Switches. The PITCH and ROLL
     switches located along the bottom of the MISC
                                                                                          4
     panel engage the autopilot and allow the pilot to
                                                                                   4
     select the desired autopilot modes.
     (See Autopilot Settings for more information.)
2.   Paddle Switch. The Paddle switch on the base of
                                                                 1
     the Side Stick Controller (SSC) is used to
     momentarily disengage the autopilot for the
     duration that the switch is depressed and held.                           3
     When released, the autopilot will attempt to
     capture new reference values of pitch, roll, and/or                                      2
     altitude, depending on the autopilot modes that
     have been selected using the PITCH and ROLL
     switches on the MISC panel.
     (See Hands-On Controls for more information.)
3.   EHSI Heading Set Knob. When the autopilot is
     engaged and the ROLL switch is set to the HDG
     SEL position, the Heading Set knob on the EHSI is
     used to select the heading reference to which the
     autopilot will turn toward and maintain.
     (See Electronic Horizontal Situation Indicator for
     more information.)
4.   Steerpoint Navigation. When the autopilot is engaged and the ROLL switch is set to the STRG SEL
     position, the Upfront Controls may be used to select the steerpoint used for navigation.
     (See Selecting a Steerpoint for more information.)
The autopilot modes selected by the corresponding PITCH and ROLL switch positions are described below.

Autopilot Settings
The PITCH and ROLL switches located along the bottom of the                        1. PITCH Switch
MISC panel engage the autopilot and allow the pilot to select the
desired autopilot modes.
1.   PITCH Switch. Enables/disables the autopilot and selects
     the autopilot mode of operation in the pitch axis.
     •    ALT HOLD. Enables the autopilot and selects Altitude
          Hold mode. The autopilot will hold the current
          barometric altitude.
     •    A/P OFF. Disables the autopilot.
     •    ATT HOLD. Enables the autopilot and selects Attitude                                  2. ROLL Switch
          Hold mode. The autopilot will hold the current pitch
          attitude.
2.   ROLL Switch. Selects the autopilot’s mode of operation within the roll axis.
     •    HDG SEL. If the PITCH switch is set to the ALT HOLD or ATT HOLD positions, the autopilot will turn
          toward and maintain the heading reference selected by the Heading Set knob on the Electronic
          Horizontal Situation Indicator (EHSI).
     •    ATT HOLD. If the PITCH switch is set to the ALT HOLD or ATT HOLD positions, the autopilot will hold
          the current roll attitude.
     •    STRG SEL. If the PITCH switch is set to the ALT HOLD or ATT HOLD positions, the autopilot will turn
          toward and maintain a direct course to the selected steerpoint.


Autopilot Engagement
If the autopilot is enabled by setting the PITCH switch to the ALT HOLD
or ATT HOLD positions, and the Paddle switch on the SSC is not
depressed, the autopilot will engage the modes of operation as
selected by the PITCH and ROLL switches. When engaged, the
autopilot will be limited to pitch command rates of +3.0 to -1.0 G, roll
rates of 20° per second, and bank angles of ±30°.
When set to the ALT HOLD or ATT HOLD positions, the PITCH switch
is held in place by an electrical solenoid. If any criteria is met that
                                                                                     PITCH switch set to         Paddle switch
results in an automatic disengagement of the autopilot, the solenoid               ALT HOLD or ATT HOLD           not pressed
holding the PITCH switch in place will release and the switch will spring
back to the A/P OFF position.




                  Pitch rate +3.0 to -1.0 G           Roll rate ≤ 20° per second             Bank angle ±30°

                                              Autopilot Command Authority

Depressing the Paddle switch on the SSC will only momentarily disengage the autopilot for the duration that the
switch is depressed and held; the PITCH switch will remain in ALT HOLD or ATT HOLD. This allows the pilot to
assign new reference values of pitch, roll, and/or altitude when the Paddle switch is released.
Autopilot Disengagement
If any of the following criteria is met, the autopilot will automatically disengage, the solenoid holding the PITCH
switch in place will release, and the switch will spring back to the A/P OFF position.
     •     Angle-of-Attack exceeds 15°.
     •     Bank angle exceeds 60°.
     •     Low speed audio warning is triggered.
     •     Landing gear is extended and locked.
     •     The autopilot has failed or malfunctioned.
     •     The FLCS is operating on Digital Backup software.
     •     ALT FLAPS switch is set to EXTEND position below 400 knots.
     •     TRIM/AP DISC switch is set to DISC position.
     •     AIR REFUEL switch is set to OPEN position.
     •     MANUAL PITCH switch is set to OVRD position.
