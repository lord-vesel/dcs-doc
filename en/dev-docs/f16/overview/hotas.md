# HANDS-ON CONTROLS (HOTAS)

The Hands-On Controls, sometimes referred to as Hands on Throttle and Stick (HOTAS), allows the pilot to
interact with the fire control system and various weapons delivery functions without taking his or her hands off
the flight controls. Some of these switches are multipurpose and their function at any given time depends upon
the aircraft master mode, weapons delivery mode, and/or the selected Sensor-Of-Interest (SOI).
Visual diagrams of the Hands-On Control functions based on Master Mode/SOI may be viewed in Appendix D.


Side Stick Controller (SSC)
The primary function of the Side Stick Controller is to provide pitch and roll commands to maneuver the aircraft.
Pushing/pulling on the SSC affects aircraft pitch (moves the horizontal tails) and moving the SSC left/right affects
roll (moves the wing trailing edge flaperons and horizontal tails; and to a lesser extent, the vertical rudder).
The SSC has several buttons and multi-position switches that permit manipulation of the key systems.

1.   Weapon Release Button. Press and hold to fire air-to-air missiles or release any air-to-ground munition.
2.   Trim Switch. Positioning the button forward and aft trims the aircraft nose up (Trim switch aft) and nose
     down (Trim switch forward). Positioning the button left and right trims the aircraft left wing down and right
     wing down respectively.
3.   Trigger. Squeezing to the first detent fires the laser designator for accurate ranging if a targeting pod is
     equipped and in Air-to-Ground (A-G) mode. Squeezing the trigger to the second detent fires the gun if
     selected and armed.
4.   Missile Step Button. This button has different functions depending on the state of the aircraft.
     •     Nose-wheel Steering. On the ground, momentarily pressing the button activates nosewheel steering
           via the rudder pedals. Pressing the button a second time disables nosewheel steering.
      •    AR Disconnect. When in flight and the AIR REFUEL switch is in the OPEN position, pressing the button
           manually disconnects the refueling boom from the aircraft’s dorsal refueling receptacle.
      •    Missile Step. When in flight and in Air-to-Air, Missile Override or Dogfight modes, a short press (<0.5
           sec) will select the next missile station of that type, and a long press (>0.5 sec) will cycle to the next
           missile type. When in flight and in Air-to-Ground (A-G) mode, a short press cycles between CCIP, DTOS
           and CCRP modes; or selects the next missile station if AGM-65 or AGM-88 is selected on the SMS page.

Throttle
The engine is controlled by a throttle mounted above the left console with detents at OFF, IDLE, MIL, and MAX
AB. The OFF position terminates engine ignition and fuel flow. The IDLE position commands minimum thrust and
is used for all ground starts and air starts. From IDLE to MIL, the throttle controls the output of the engine.
Forward of the MIL position, the throttle controls the operation of the afterburner.
The throttle has several multi-position switches and knobs that permit manipulation of the key systems. As with
the Side Stick Controller, the Hands-On Controls functions on the throttle vary in functionality depending on the
state and operational modes of the aircraft.

        Depressing the control commands the AIM-9 or AGM-65 seeker to uncage, the TGP to enter/exit LSS mode,
        or declutters the HUD when landing. When the aircraft is airborne with the landing gear down, depressing
        UNCAGE will remove the Roll Indicator and ILS Bars from the HUD and re-position the Heading Scale to the
        top portion of the HUD.

3.    DOG FIGHT Switch. The Dogfight/Missile Override switch is a three-position switch that overrides any
      mode except emergency jettison. Returning the switch to the center returns to the last selected Master
      Mode.
      •     Dogfight (outboard). This position will automatically select ACM radar mode, but the radar will go
            to standby until commanded to transmit. The HUD will display symbology for 20mm gun engagement
            along with the targeting reticles for AIM-9 or AIM-120, depending on which missile is selected. “DGFT”
            is displayed in the HUD Master Mode Status.
      •     Missile Override (inboard). This position will automatically select RWS radar mode and display HUD
            symbology for A-A missile delivery. Gun will be unavailable for selection. “MRM”, “SRM” or “HOB” will
            be displayed in the HUD Master Mode Status, depending on which missile type is selected. If no air-to-
            air missiles have been loaded, “MSL” is displayed in the HUD Master Mode Status.
4.    ANT ELEV Knob. The Antenna Elevation knob is used to manually set the radar antenna elevation angle.
5.    RDR CURSOR/ENABLE Control. Used for slewing the cursor on the FCR, HSD, and HAD pages; the cursor
      on the WPN page when AGM-88 is selected in HAS mode; slewing the TGP sensor; or slewing the AGM-65
      seeker. When in A-A master mode, pressing and holding this control swaps the BORE/SLAVE option for the
      AIM-9 missiles while the control is depressed. When in A-G master mode with AGM-65 missiles selected,
      pressing this control will step through PRE/VIS/BORE mode options.

6.    SPD BRK Switch. The aft position extends the speedbrakes and the forward position retracts the
      speedbrakes, with the switch spring-loaded out of the aft position back to center. Extension and retraction
      movement occurs for as long as the SPD BRK switch is held in either position, allowing the speedbrakes to
      be stopped at any intermediate position as desired.

      The speedbrakes may be fully extended to 60° when the right main landing gear is not down and locked.
      When the right main landing gear is down and locked, the speedbrakes are limited to 43° to prevent the
      lower speedbrake surfaces from striking the ground upon landing. This limitation may be temporarily
      overridden by holding the SPD BRK switch to the aft position. When the nose landing gear compresses after
      landing, the speedbrakes may once again be fully opened without needing to hold the SPD BRK switch aft.
