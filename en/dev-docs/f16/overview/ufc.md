# UPFRONT CONTROLS (UFC)

The Upfront Controls (UFC) include the Integrated Control Panel (ICP) and the Data Entry Display (DED). These
components provide a method of quick access for navigation control, communications, fire control system modes,
and data entry throughout the mission. The most commonly used functions are available on the ICP itself; but
less frequently used functions, such as power and audio volume, are located on console panels.
Data accessed through the ICP is displayed on the DED.




             Integrated Control Panel (ICP)




                                                                               Data Entry Display (DED)




The Upfront Controls are available when the C & I knob is set
to the UFC position on the IFF control panel. During normal
operations, the Upfront Controls are used for various data
entry and system management functions of communications,
navigation, and IFF. In the event there is a failure with the
Upfront Controls, the C & I knob can be set to the BACK UP
position, which allows control of the UHF radio and IFF through
the use of the UHF Backup panel and the IFF control panel.
Note that even when the C & I knob is set to the UFC position,
the MASTER knob on the IFF control panel is still used to
enable/disable operation of the APX-113 Advanced IFF
transponder/interrogator system.
Integrated Control Panel (ICP)
The Integrated Control Panel fills the top center portion of the instrument panel and is one of the core components
for interfacing with the communications, navigation, and IFF systems (also called CNI) of the F-16C. In addition
to the CNI-related functions, the ICP provides master mode selection, controls for manipulating and entering data
into the DED, and HUD symbology brightness control.

8.   BRT Knob. The HUD raster intensity knob is not used in the Block 50 F-16.
9.   CONT Knob. The HUD raster contrast knob is not used in the Block 50 F-16.
10. Mode Select (M-SEL) Button. Cycles through available modes or settings on various DED pages. The
    button is also used to input a zero or a negative value on the currently displayed DED page, as necessary.
    It’s specific functionality for each DED page is described in the respective DED page sections.
11. DED Increment/Decrement Rocker. This switch increases or decreases values for the field selected on
    the current DED page. Values that can be increased or decreased are identified by an up and down arrow
    next to them on the DED page. The DCS is used to cycle between available fields.
12. Data Control Switch (DCS). Also known as the “Dobber” switch; moves the asterisks or the
    increment/decrement symbol on the DED, sequences through different data fields, and returns the DED to
    the CNI page. It’s specific functionality for each DED page is described in the respective DED page sections.
13. DRIFT C/O & WARN RESET Switch. Cages/releases HUD symbology to indicate the aircraft’s true flight
    path and removes messages from the center of the HUD.
     •    DRIFT C/O. Setting the switch to this position will horizontally cage the Flight Path Marker to the
          center of the HUD and the Attitude Bars to the Boresight Cross. This may be used if the FPM and
          Attitude Bars drift out of view from crosswinds or sideslip, or if a failure or degradation has occurred
          in the INS and it is operating in Attitude mode.
     •    NORM. Spring-loaded to this position from WARN RESET. Allows the FPM and Attitude Bars to drift
          left or right with the aircraft’s true flight path.
     •    WARN RESET. Resets warnings presented on the HUD and their associated voice messages. Resets
          the HUD Maximum G indicator to 1.0.
14. TFR/FLIR Controls. The TFR WX button, FLIR Increment/Decrement rocker, and FLIR GAIN/LVL/AUTO
    switch are not used in the Block 50 F-16.
Data Entry Display (DED)
The Data Entry Display is an LED-display that allows the pilot to access a variety of mission and system settings
and, if necessary, edit or modify mission data or system settings directly from the cockpit.
The CNI DED page may be considered the “home” page, in that the CNI page is commonly displayed during a
mission when the DED is not in active use. In addition, the ICP Priority Function buttons can only be accessed
when the CNI is displayed on the DED. Any time the Data Control Switch (DCS), also called the “Dobber” switch,
is moved to the RTN position, the DED will return to the CNI page. When returning to the CNI page, any data
that was entered but not accepted on the previous DED page will be erased.
Any time the UHF, VHF, IFF or LIST pages are called up using their respective Override buttons along the top of
the ICP, pressing the button a second time will return the DED to the previous state.
Each of the DED page labels in the figure below and on the following page may be left-clicked to immediately
move to the corresponding manual section describing the function of that page.

1.   CARA ALOW. Displays the altitude above ground level (AGL)
     at which the Combined Altitude Radar Altimeter will trigger a                 Altitude Low Setting
     low altitude warning. May be modified by placing the DED
     asterisks over the data field, entering an altitude (in feet)
     using the ICP keypad, and pressing ENTR.
     When the radar altimeter indicates the aircraft is below this
     altitude, the Altitude Low Setting will flash in the HUD and an
     accompanying “ALTITUDE…ALTITUDE” voice message will be
     heard.
     Note that this setting is based on the altitude above ground
     level (AGL) and requires the radar altimeter to be powered on
     and transmitting for this warning to function. If the landing
     gear is down, the voice message is inhibited.
2.   MSL FLOOR. Displays the altitude above mean sea level (MSL) at which the altimeter will trigger a low
     altitude warning. May be modified by placing the DED asterisks over the data field, entering an altitude (in
     feet) using the ICP keypad, and pressing ENTR.
     When the barometric altimeter indicates the aircraft is below this altitude, an “ALTITUDE…ALTITUDE” voice
     message will be heard.
3.   Selected Steerpoint. Displays the selected steerpoint. The ICP Increment/Decrement rocker may be used
     to cycle to a different steerpoint.
4.   DED Asterisks. If a data field on the DED is bracketed by these symbols, the ICP keypad may be used to
     enter a different value, or the 0/M-SEL button may be used to enable it in some cases. A data field that has
     been modified but has not been accepted will be highlighted. When the modified data is accepted (ICP ENTR
     button) or rejected (ICP RCL button) the data field will be returned to normal, de-highlighted text.

     Only one CRUS mode may be enabled at any given time. Enabling CRUS TOS mode will disable any other
     CRUS mode that is already enabled.
2.   System Time. Displays the aircraft system time in a 24-hour time format.
3.   Desired Time-Over-Steerpoint. Displays the desired time to arrive over the selected steerpoint, in a 24-
     hour time format. This can be used to synchronize tactical actions with other forces within the battlespace.
4.   Estimated Time-of-Arrival. Displays the estimated time that the aircraft will arrive over the selected
     steerpoint at the current ground speed if flown directly toward the steerpoint, in a 24-hour time format.
5.   Required Ground Speed. Displays the ground speed that is required in order to arrive over the selected
     steerpoint at the desired TOS, if flown directly toward the steerpoint.
6.   Selected Steerpoint. Displays the selected steerpoint. The ICP Increment/Decrement rocker may be used
     to cycle to a different steerpoint.
7.   DED Asterisks. If a data field on the DED is bracketed by these symbols, the ICP keypad may be used to
     enter a different value, or the 0/M-SEL button may be used to enable it in some cases. A data field that has
     been modified but has not been accepted will be highlighted. When the modified data is accepted (ICP ENTR
     button) or rejected (ICP RCL button) the data field will be returned to normal, de-highlighted text.
When CRUS TOS mode is enabled, a speed caret will be displayed along the HUD Velocity Scale (if shown) that
corresponds with the speed required to arrive at the selected steerpoint’s desired TOS, if flown directly toward
the steerpoint. The HUD Time To Go data field will be replaced with the Estimated Time-of-Arrival (ETA) to that
steerpoint at the current ground speed.
If the landing gear is down, the caret is removed from the HUD.

3.   Fuel at Home point. Displays an estimate of the remaining fuel onboard when the aircraft arrives at the
     steerpoint that is set as the Home point, if flown directly toward the steerpoint at optimum speed and
     altitude. This value is also displayed on the HUD below the Master Mode, in hundreds of pounds. If the
     landing gear is down, this data field will remain at the last calculated value.
4.   Optimum Cruise Altitude. Displays the altitude that will result in the most fuel efficient flight profile based
     on the current gross weight and corresponding angle-of-attack required to maintain level flight. As fuel is
     burned and weight decreases, this altitude will also increase due to the increased fuel efficiency for lower
     angles-of-attack. If the landing gear is down, this data field will remain at the last calculated value.
5.   Wind Direction/Speed. Displays the current wind direction (in degrees magnetic) and wind speed as
     calculated by the CADC. If the landing gear is down, this data field will remain at the last calculated value.
6.   DED Asterisks. If a data field on the DED is bracketed by these symbols, the ICP keypad may be used to
     enter a different value, or the 0/M-SEL button may be used to enable it in some cases. A data field that has
     been modified but has not been accepted will be highlighted. When the modified data is accepted (ICP ENTR
     button) or rejected (ICP RCL button) the data field will be returned to normal, de-highlighted text.
When CRUS HOME mode is enabled, the steerpoint set as the Home point becomes the selected steerpoint, and
speed and altitude carets are displayed along the HUD Velocity Scale and Altitude Scales (if shown) that
correspond with the speed and altitude profile that will return to the Home steerpoint using the minimum amount
of fuel. The profile includes a minimum fuel climb at military power or a descent at idle power to the optimum
altitude, a gradual cruise climb in which the altitude increases as fuel is burned, and a final descent at idle power
to a point 5,000 feet over the Home steerpoint.
If the landing gear is down, the carets are removed from the HUD.

In the example above, the onboard fuel quantity will be depleted to the Bingo value in approximately 58 minutes,
based on the current rate of fuel consumption. The speed caret indicates that the pilot should reduce the Mach
number to 0.57 to minimize the rate of fuel consumption, based on the current altitude, to maximize the remaining
flight endurance.
TIME DED Page
The Time DED page is accessed by pressing the 6/TIME button on the ICP keypad when the CNI page is

1.   System Time. Displays the internal system time in a 24-hour time format based on Zulu time (UTC). May
     be modified by placing the DED asterisks over the data field, inputting a time in HHMMSS format using the
     ICP keypad, and pressing ENTR.
     When GPS data is available, time is automatically entered and “GPS SYSTEM” will be displayed. Manual time
     may be entered if necessary, and “SYSTEM” will be displayed; but is not required unless GPS data is not
     available.
2.   Hack Time. Displays an additional time reference independent of System Time. This can be used as a
     separate time reference for the local time zone, or as a stopwatch for low-level navigation or vulnerability
     periods.
3.   Delta Time-Over-Steerpoint. Updates the Time-Over-Steerpoint (TOS) values across all steerpoints using
     a single delta value. When a Delta TOS is applied, it will automatically increase or decrease all valid TOS
     entries for each steerpoint. This may be used if coordinated strikes or tactical actions must be adjusted
     dynamically mid-mission, in which the entire mission timeline may be moved earlier or later as needed.
     As an example, if the required time adjustment is 5 minutes, a Delta TOS would be entered as -00:05:00 or
     00:05:00, depending on whether the 5 minute adjustment was to an earlier time or a later time, respectively.
     Valid Delta TOS entries range from -23:59:59 to 23:59:59 in HHMMSS format. To enter a negative value (to
     adjust all TOS to an earlier time), press 0/M-SEL to enter a negative symbol, followed by the delta itself.
     NOTE: Delta TOS adjustments are cumulative while the TIME DED page is displayed. However, if the DED
     is set to a different page, the DELTA TOS data field itself will be zeroed even though the TOS adjustments
     to all steerpoints will remain applied.
4.   System Date. Displays the internal system date. System date is automatically entered into the avionics

1.   Wingspan. Displays the manual target wingspan in use by the EEGS sub-mode. This value adjusts the
     width of the EEGS Funnel to account for aircraft of different wingspans. When the target wings are perfectly
     bracketed within the EEGS Funnel, an optimal air-to-air gun solution has been obtained. May be modified
     using the ICP keypad by placing the DED asterisks over the data field, inputting a wingspan value (in feet),
     and pressing ENTR.
     This is particularly important when engaging a hostile aircraft when using the Enhanced Envelope Gun Sight
     (EEGS) in Level II, in which case a passive ranging solution is necessary due to lack of an FCR-derived
     weapon solution. (See Air-to-Air Gunnery for more information.)
2.   Range. Displays the horizontal distance a free-fall weapon is expected to travel under specific conditions.
     (N/I)
3.   Time-Of-Fall. Displays the time that is expect to elapse between the time of weapon release and the
     surface impact under specific conditons. (N/I)
4.   Selected Steerpoint. Displays the selected steerpoint. The ICP Increment/Decrement rocker may be used
     to cycle to a different steerpoint.
5.   DED Asterisks. If a data field on the DED is bracketed by these symbols, the ICP keypad may be used to
     enter a different value, or the 0/M-SEL button may be used to enable it in some cases. A data field that has
     been modified but has not been accepted will be highlighted. When the modified data is accepted (ICP ENTR
     button) or rejected (ICP RCL button) the data field will be returned to normal, de-highlighted text.
MODE DED Page
The Mode DED page is accessed by pressing 8/FIX on the ICP keypad when the LIST DED page is displayed.
This page is used as a backup method to change the master mode between NAV, A-A, or A-G, in case there is a

1.   Mode Select. Displays the master mode (“A-A” or “A-G”) that will be entered if the 0/M-SEL button is
     pressed. Momentarily setting the DCS (“Dobber switch”) to the SEQ position or pressing any button on the
     ICP keypad will toggle the DED page between A-A and A-G modes. If the current master mode matches the
     mode displayed on the DED Mode page, the text between the DED Asterisks will be highlighted. Pressing
     the 0/M-SEL button when the DED Mode Select data field is highlighted will set the master mode to NAV.
     NOTE: This page is not functional if the Dogfight switch on the throttle is set to the outboard (Dogfight) or
     inboard (Missile Override) positions.
2.   DED Asterisks. If a data field on the DED is bracketed by these symbols, the ICP keypad may be used to
     enter a different value, or the 0/M-SEL button may be used to enable it in some cases. A data field that has
     been modified but has not been accepted will be highlighted. When the modified data is accepted (ICP ENTR
     button) or rejected (ICP RCL button) the data field will be returned to normal, de-highlighted text.
