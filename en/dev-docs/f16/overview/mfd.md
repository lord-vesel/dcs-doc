# MULTI-FUNCTION DISPLAYS (MFD)

Two color Multi-Function Displays (MFD) provide video and text presentations to the pilot for the aircraft’s various
sensors. The MFDs also serve as the primary interface to the aircraft’s external stores, data transfer and loading
equipment, and diagnostics for the aircraft systems and flight controls.
Each sensor or aircraft system can be accessed via their respective MFD “format”. Some MFD formats will include
multiple “pages” that can be selected to access additional options or settings. The options and settings associated
with the systems of each format or page are controlled through Option Select Buttons (OSBs) around the display
bezel of each MFD. Each OSB interacts with the text displayed next to it to toggle through functions or select a
different page.
Additionally, four rocker buttons are present on each MFD that allows the pilot to adjust the appearance of the
video and text on the MFD screen itself.

Re-assigning MFD Formats
Each of the seven avionics master modes (Navigation, Air-to-Air, Air-to-Ground, Missile Override, Dogfight,
Selective Jettison, and Emergency Jettison) are initialized with pre-configured MFD formats assigned to each
Format Select button of each MFD. These MFD format assignments can be re-configured by the pilot at any time
via the Format Selection Master Menu page.
To assign a different format to a Format Select button (OSB 12, OSB 13 or OSB 14) on either MFD, set the
avionics to the master mode that is meant to be edited.
1.   If the MFD text above the Format Select OSB that is to be re-
     assigned to a different MFD format is already highlighted,
     press that same OSB to open the Format Selection Master
     Menu page.
     If the MFD text above the Format Select OSB that is to be re-
     assigned to a different MFD format is not highlighted, press
     that same OSB to highlight the corresponding text above it,
     and then press that same OSB a second time to open the
     Format Selection Master Menu page.
                                                                                  OSB 13 is highlighted
                                                                                      and pressed
     If the Format Select OSB that is to be re-assigned to a
     different MFD format is assigned the BLANK format with no
     corresponding text above it, press that same OSB to highlight
     the empty text field above it, and then press that same OSB
     a second time to open the Format Selection Master Menu
     page.


2.   The MFD format that is already assigned to the currently
     selected Format Select OSB will be highlighted among the
     available formats displayed on the Master Menu page. Press
     the OSB next to the corresponding MFD format in the menu
     to assign that format to the currently selected Format Select
     OSB. The MFD will exit the Master Menu page and display the
     assigned format for that Format Select button.
     If the pilot does not wish to change the MFD format of the
     currently selected Format Select OSB, selecting the format                   TGP format is selected
     that is already assigned to that Format Select button or                    from Master Menu page
     selecting any of the Format Select buttons themselves along
     the bottom of the MFD will exit the Master Menu page with no
     changes made.
NOTE: In any given master mode, an MFD format can only
be assigned to one Format Select button on either MFD at a
time. The exception to this limitation is the BLANK format,
which can be assigned to multiple Format Select buttons. It is
possible that all six Format select buttons on the MFDs could
be assigned to the BLANK format for a given master mode,
despite the impracticality of it.
If an MFD format is assigned from the Master Menu page that
is already assigned to another Format Select button on either
                                                                    TGP format is
MFD, that format will be removed from the other Format           assigned to OSB 13
Select button and assigned to the currently highlighted OSB,
and the BLANK format will be assigned to the former.
