# WEAPONS & MUNITIONS
M61A1 Vulcan 20mm Cannon
The F-16 is equipped with an internal M61 Vulcan six-barreled
rotary cannon. The M61 can employ M50- or PGU-series
20x102mm projectiles at 6,000 rounds per minute and is effective
against both air and surface targets. PGU-series rounds provide
increased range and decreased time of flight compared to M50-
series ammunition. The ammunition drum carries 510 rounds, of
which six different types can be chosen for loading:
M56 HEI. High-Explosive Incendiary rounds. HEI rounds have
both explosive and incendiary effects, making them effective
                                                                                A1C Kimberly Barrera (USAF)
against aircraft, light vehicles, and personnel.
M56/M242 HEI-T. High-Explosive Incendiary rounds with Tracer mix. M242 tracer rounds are substituted for
HEI rounds at regular intervals. The tracer rounds glow brightly when fired, allowing the pilot to visually see the
ballistic path of the fired projectiles.
M53 API. Armor-Piercing Incendiary rounds. Armor-piercing rounds are made from solid steel with a combined
incendiary effect, making them capable of penetrating armored vehicles. However, they have no explosive effects
upon impact, which makes them less effective against personnel.
M55/M220 TP. Target Practice rounds. TP rounds are inert with only kinetic effects upon impact. TP mix always
contains M220 tracer rounds at regular intervals.
PGU-28A/B SAPHEI. Semi-Armor-Piercing High-Explosive Incendiary rounds. These rounds have both
incendiary/explosive effects and armor-piercing capability. The rounds are constructed such that the incendiary
and explosive effects are triggered after penetration of the armor. SAPHEI rounds are effective against a wide
range of vehicles but are not generally effective against personnel.
PGU-27A/B TP. Target Practice rounds. TP rounds are inert with only kinetic effects upon impact. TP mix always
contains PGU-30A/B tracer rounds at regular intervals.


AIM-9 Sidewinder
The AIM-9 Sidewinder is an infrared-guided (heat-seeking) short-
range air-to-air missile. It first entered service in 1956 and has
since become one of the most successful missiles in the West. Its
longevity is thanks to its versatility and continued improvement
over multiple generations.
The AIM-9 uses an array of up to five scanning infrared sensors,
cooled by an internal argon bottle (L and M models). The
Sidewinder has a maximum speed of over Mach 2.5 and a
maximum range of around 10 to 20 miles, depending on the
variant. Minimum range is around 3,000 feet.
                                                                               SSgt Darnell T. Cannady (USAF)
A single AIM-9 can be mounted on any of the F-16C’s air-to-air
stations.
AIM-9L Sidewinder. The “Lima” model was the first all-aspect Sidewinder fielded in 1977, meaning it no longer
required the target to present a rear profile. The AIM-9L earned its first kill when it struck a Libyan Su-22, after
being fired from an F-14 Tomcat, in the infamous Gulf of Sidra engagement of 1981.
AIM-9M Sidewinder. The “Mike” model introduced in 1982 improved on the Guidance Control Section (GCS).
Susceptibility to flares was reduced, and background discrimination was improved, resulting in a greater chance
of target acquisition. The rocket motor’s smoke signature was reduced, making the missile less likely to be seen.
AIM-9X Sidewinder. The “X-ray” model introduced in 2003 is the latest iteration of the Sidewinder. The 9X
adds high-angle off-boresight (HOB) capability and the ability to slave the seeker head to a helmet-mounted
sight, such as the JHMCS. The missile’s maneuverability was boosted with all-axis thrust-vectoring capability.
These changes allow the pilot to simply “point their head and shoot” in nearly any direction, greatly increasing
reaction time and lethality in air-to-air combat, even when in a defensive position. The infrared sensor was
replaced with focal-plane arrays (FPAs) and counter-countermeasures capability was further improved. Electronic
fuzing was added to reduce minimum range.
CAP-9M. Captive variant of the AIM-9M. The captive variant has the same size, weight, and drag characteristics
as the AIM-9M, for training effectiveness. It also contains an integrated infrared sensor and will provide audio
and visual guidance cues to the pilot, but it does not have a rocket motor and cannot be fired from the aircraft.


AIM-120 AMRAAM
The AIM-120 AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air
Missile) is an active radar-homing, medium-range air-to-air missile.
First introduced in 1982, the AMRAAM was intended to replace the
semi-active radar homing AIM-7 Sparrow, which was the medium-
range BVR missile in the U.S. inventory at the time.
The AIM-120 uses both command guidance and radar homing to
reach its target. The AIM-120’s integral radar has a comparatively
short range and relies on steering signals transmitted automatically
from the launching aircraft via a radio datalink. The AMRAAM has
a maximum speed around Mach 4 and a maximum range of 30 to
40 miles.                                                                      SSgt Sheila deVera (USAF)

AIM-120B AMRAAM. The B model was fielded in 1994 with improved guidance over the A-model.
AIM-120C AMRAAM. The C variant was fielded in 1996 and featured a slightly larger rocket motor, improved
guidance, electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM), and re-designed fins for carriage within the internal
weapon bays of the F-22.


AGM-88 HARM
The AGM-88 HARM (High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile) is a passive
radar homing air-to-ground missile used in the Suppression of
Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) role. The HARM has a radar receiver
and processor that detects and identifies signals from enemy
surface radars. When launched, it can guide to the target by
homing on its specific radar emissions. The missile also has an
inertial guidance system to provide mid-course guidance prior to
detection of the radar signal (or if the signal is lost).
The AGM-88 has a maximum speed of Mach 1.84 and an
operational range of around 80 nautical miles. The missile can be
employed using several different engagement profiles that can be               SSgt Scott Stewart (USAF)
selected prior to launch. It uses a laser proximity fuze for
detonation to increase its area of weapons effects.
AGM-88C. This mid-1980s variant incorporates field-reprogrammable software and improved guidance and
fuzing.
AGM-65 Maverick
The AGM-65 Maverick is a medium-range air-to-ground missile
designed for the close air support role. The AGM-65 family contains
a diverse set of variants and guidance systems, including infrared,
electro-optical, and laser guidance.
The AGM-65 has a maximum range of around 13 nautical miles. A
single Maverick can be mounted to an LAU-117 rack, or up to 3 can
be carried on an LAU-88 rack.
AGM-65D Maverick. The D model contains an imaging infrared
sensor and guidance system. The sensor can locate and track
targets during daylight and at night, in clear or restricted-visibility         SSgt Glenn B. Lindsey (USAF)
weather conditions. It contains a 125-pound shaped-charge
warhead.
AGM-65G Maverick. The G model has the same guidance system as the D model, but with a larger 300-pound
penetrating warhead, making it more effective against hardened targets.
AGM-65H Maverick. The H model uses a digital CCD sensor, making it effective in daylight only. The H model
is capable of forced correlation and does not require a target centroid to track. It contains a 125-pound shaped-
charge warhead.
AGM-65K Maverick. The K model has the same guidance system as the H model, but with a larger 300-pound
penetrating warhead.


Mark 80-Series General-Purpose Bombs
The Mark 80-series of general-purpose bombs is a series of
unguided bombs dating back to the Vietnam War. The bombs come
in nominal weights of 500, 1,000, and 2,000 pounds, and can be
fitted with a variety of nose and tail fuzes or precision guidance
kits.
The Mark 80-series bombs can be fitted to any air-to-ground pylon.
The Mk-82 can also be mounted to a triple ejector rack (the TER-
9A) in pairs or triples.
Mk-82. A 500-pound, general-purpose bomb.
                                                                                 SSgt Randy Mallard (USAF)
Mk-82 Snakeye. A Mk-82 with Mk15 retarding petals that extend
after release. The petals reduce the bomb’s downrange speed after
release, allowing aircraft to perform low-level straight-through deliveries at lower altitudes without risk of frag
damage.
Mk-82 AIR. A Mk-82 with a BSU-49/B Air Inflatable Retarder (AIR). The AIR is a ballute that expands after
release, performing the same retarding function as the Mk15. The BSU-49B is a newer technology and is more
effective than the Mk15, making the bomb safe to use at higher speeds than the Snakeyes.
Mk-84. A 2,000-pound, general-purpose bomb.
Mk-84 AIR. A Mk-84 with a BSU-50 Air Inflatable Retarder (AIR). The Mk-84 AIR is available as a 2,000-poound
general purpose bomb and a 2,000-pound inert training munition variant.
BDU-50 Training Munitions
The BDU-50 is an inert, releasable training munition with the same
mass and shape as the Mk-82 500-pound bomb but lacks a
warhead.
The BDU-50 can be mounted directly to any air-to-ground pylon,
or up to three can be mounted on a TER-9A triple ejector rack.
BDU-50LD. Simulates the low-drag or “slick” version of the Mk-
82.
BDU-50HD. Simulates the high-drag, ballute-equipped Mk-82
AIR.                                                                     SSgt Fernando Serna (USAF)
BDU-50LGB. Simulates the GBU-12, a Mk-82 equipped with a
Paveway II laser-guided bomb kit.


BDU-33 Training Munitions
The BDU-33 is an inert, releasable training munition with a ballistic
flight profile that simulates the Mk-82 500-pound bomb. Upon
impact, the BDU-33 releases a smoke cloud that can be used to
identify the impact point.
The BDU-33 can be loaded in sets of three on the TER-9A triple
ejector rack.




                                                                        SSgt James R. Ferguson (USAF)

CBU-87 Combined Effects Munition
The CBU-87 Combined Effects Munition is an unguided cluster
bomb that was developed in 1986. Each bomb contains an SUU-
65/B canister and 202 BLU-97/B submunitions. These have both
fragmentation and incendiary effects and are effective against
vehicles and personnel.
After being released, the CBU-87 begins to spin at a pre-set speed.
It falls to a preprogrammed burst altitude, at which point the
canister separates and the submunitions are dispersed.
The CBU-87 can be mounted directly to any air-to-ground pylon,
or up to three can be mounted on a TER-9A triple ejector rack.
                                                                           SrA Edward Braly (USAF)
CBU-97 Sensor-Fuzed Weapon
The CBU-97 Sensor-Fuzed Weapon is an unguided cluster bomb
containing target-discriminating submunitions. Each bomb contains
a SUU-66/B canister and 10 BLU-108 submunitions. When the
bomb approaches its preprogrammed burst altitude, the canister
opens and the submunitions are released. The submunitions deploy
parachutes at preprogrammed intervals to increase lateral spacing.
Once the submunitions reach the burst altitude, the parachute is
separated, and a rocket motor spins the submunition and stops its
descent. Each submunition releases four “Skeets,” which are
ejected in four different directions.
                                                                                       Cindy Farmer (US)
The Skeets have ground-facing laser and infrared sensors, both of
which are used to detect the presence of a vehicle. When a vehicle
is detected, the Skeet detonates, firing an explosively formed projectile (EFP) downward toward the vehicle. The
EFP usually strikes the radiative part of the vehicle (usually the engine) as detected by the Skeet’s infrared sensor
and penetrates its armor, using pure kinetic energy to produce lethal effects.
If a vehicle is not detected, they will self-destruct before reaching the ground. This helps reduce collateral
casualties associated with the use of cluster munitions.
The CBU-97 can be mounted directly to any air-to-ground pylon, or up to three can be mounted on a TER-9A
triple ejector rack.


Paveway II Laser-Guided Bombs
The Paveway II is a series of laser-guided bombs based on
conventional general-purpose bombs. The guidance kit consists of
a laser detector and processor in the front and a set of steering
fins in the back. The bomb detects and tracks reflected laser energy
off a target. The laser designation can come from the launching
aircraft, another aircraft (“buddy lasing”), or from a laser-capable
ground unit such as a JTAC.
The Paveway II series was introduced in the early 1970s to replace
the first-generation Paveway series of laser-guided bombs. The
Paveway II improved sensor reliability and added extendible rear
fins to extend glide range. The Paveway II series uses “bang-bang”              SSgt Glenn B. Lindsey (USAF)
control (where the fins can only deflect fully in either direction),
limiting its maximum range and forcing it to follow a sinusoidal path to the target.
The Paveway II series of weapons can be mounted on any air-to-ground pylon. The GBU-12 can be mounted in
pairs using a TER-9A triple ejector rack.
GBU-12. Mk-82 500-pound conventional bomb equipped with a Paveway II laser-guidance kit.
GBU-10. Mk-84 2,000-pound conventional bomb equipped with a Paveway II laser-guidance kit.
Paveway III Laser-Guided Bombs
The Paveway III is an improved guidance kit over the earlier
Paveway II, for 2,000-pound class bombs. The upgrades include
new, larger control surfaces that provide greater aerodynamic
efficiency, a larger seeker field-of-regard, improved proportional
guidance logic for flying shaped trajectories, and terminal impact
options for optimizing weapon effects.
The Paveway III enables strike aircraft to perform low-level laser-
guided bomb attacks from a wide variety of ranges and altitudes
by utilizing the greater flight efficiency and trajectory options                   USAF
provided by the kit.
The Paveway III can be mounted on any air-to-ground pylon.
GBU-24A/B. BLU-109 2,000-pound hardened penetration bomb equipped with a Paveway III laser-guidance
kit.


Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM)
JDAM is an inertial and GPS guidance kit that can be mounted to a
general-purpose bomb, enabling it to attack a pinpoint target based
on coordinates downloaded from the aircraft. The JDAM’s precision
is not degraded by weather and the bomb is completely fire-and-
forget; however, the JDAM cannot be re-targeted after launch, nor
can it engage moving vehicles.
JDAM development began in 1992 from a proposal for an adverse-
weather precision-guided munition. The proposal was created in
response to degraded laser-guided bomb performance during
Operation Desert Storm. The first JDAM kits were delivered to the
U.S. military in 1997, and the first employment was from a B-2          SMSgt Edward E. Snyder (USAF)
during Operation Allied Force in 1999.
The GBU-38 and GBU-31 can be mounted on any air-to-ground pylon. The GBU-38 can be mounted in pairs using
a BRU-57 bomb rack.
GBU-38. Mk-82 500-pound conventional bomb equipped with JDAM guidance kit.
GBU-31(V)1/B. Mk-84 2,000-pound conventional bomb equipped with JDAM guidance kit.
GBU-31(V)3/B. BLU-109 2,000-pound hardened penetration bomb equipped with JDAM guidance kit.
AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW)
JSOW is an inertially-aided glide bomb with exceptional glide range
due to its folding wings. Like JDAM, JSOW can attack pinpoint
targets using pre-designated GPS coordinates. The JSOW’s
precision is not degraded by weather and the bomb is completely
fire-and-forget; however, the JSOW cannot be re-targeted after
launch, nor can it engage moving vehicles.
Range is dependent on launch parameters, especially the altitude
and speed of the aircraft at release.
The AGM-154A can be mounted on any air-to-ground pylon or
mounted in pairs using a BRU-57 bomb rack.                                 TSgt Cary Humphries (USAF)
AGM-154A. The AGM-154A variant was consists of 145 BLU-97/B
combined effects submunitions, identical to those used in the CBU-87 and CBU-103.


Wind-Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD)
WCMD (pronounced “wick-mid”) is a precision guidance kit for the
CBU-87 and CBU-97 cluster weapons. The tail kit includes an
integrated INS which is initialized from the aircraft’s onboard GPS
position just before release. The guidance system can be
programmed with the winds aloft to enhance accuracy, giving it as
low as an 85-foot circular error probable (CEP).
The CBU-103 and CBU-105 can be mounted on any air-to-ground
pylon or mounted in pairs using a BRU-57 bomb rack.
CBU-103. CBU-87 Combined Effects Munition (CEM) cluster bomb
equipped with WCMD guidance kit.                                          SrA Jonathan E. Ramos (USAF)
CBU-105. CBU-97 Sensor-Fuzed Weapon (SFW) cluster bomb
equipped with WCMD guidance kit.


2.75-inch Unguided Rockets
The Hydra 70 family of 2.75-inch unguided rockets may be
equipped with a variety of warhead types and fuzes, which can be
loaded onto any air-to-ground pylon using 7-tube LAU-68 or LAU-
131 launchers or 19-tube LAU-3 launchers. The following warhead
variants are available in the DCS F-16C.
M151 HE. High-explosive warhead with fragmentation effects.
Effective against personnel and light vehicles.
M156 WP. White phosphorous warhead that creates a smoke
effect on impact. Used for marking ground targets.
Mk5 HEAT. High-explosive anti-tank warhead with both
fragmentation and armor piercing effects. Effective against                 BrokenSphere (CC-BY-SA)
personnel and most vehicles.
Mk61 Practice. Training rocket with an inert warhead.
WTU-1/B Practice. Training rocket with an inert warhead.
External Fuel Tanks
External fuel tanks carry additional fuel to increase the F-16’s range
and combat radius and can be refueled during air-to-air refueling.
Like most munitions, the fuel tanks are capable of being jettisoned
if necessary.
370-gallon external wing tank. The 370-gallon wing tank adds
approximately 2,500 pounds of fuel. It can be carried on pylons 4
and 6 under each wing.
300-gallon external centerline tank. The 300-gallon centerline
tank adds approximately 2,000 pounds of fuel. It can only be
carried on pylon 5 under the fuselage.                                      SMSgt Edward E. Snyder (USAF)



Targeting/Sensor Pods
Externally mounted targeting pods can be equipped to the left and right “chin” hardpoints on either side of the
intake. These targeting systems provide additional capabilities for detecting, acquiring, and engaging enemy
forces such as ground vehicles and air defenses from outside the visual range of the pilot, and with greater
accuracy and fidelity than the air-to-ground modes of the fire control radar.
AN/AAQ-28 Litening II. The AN/AAQ-28 Litening II is an
electro-optical and infrared targeting pod that can be attached to
the right chin hardpoint on the F-16C. It includes a steerable
camera with a powerful magnification range for detecting targets
at long distances during the day, and a steerable forward looking
infrared (FLIR) sensor for detecting targets during the day as well
as night. The Litening pod also includes a laser
rangefinder/designator for illuminating targets with laser energy
and a laser spot tracker for detecting laser designations of other
friendly forces on or over the battlefield.
(See Litening II Targeting Pod for more information.)                       Litening Targeting Pod (USAF)

AN/ASQ-213 HARM Targeting System (HTS). The HARM
Targeting System is an electronic detection and geolocation sensor
that is exclusively designed for the F-16C when performing
Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) missions. The HTS pod
detects and classifies hostile air defense radar emissions and uses
signals triangulation to precisely determine the location of threat
radar systems on the battlefield. When a threat radar is detected,
the HTS pod can then handoff the radar location to the AGM-88
HARM missiles for engagement, even threat radars that are well
outside the forward search cone of the HARM missiles themselves.
While the HTS pod is not required to employ the AGM-88 HARM                 HARM Targeting System (USAF)
missile, it does enable the targeting of threat radars more
efficiently. The HTS pod also dramatically increases the pilot’s situational awareness of the threat radar
environment in the surrounding airspace and allows the pilot to make critical decisions regarding which threats
must be avoided and which threats must be engaged to accomplish their mission.
(See HARM Targeting System for more information.)
Electronic Countermeasure (ECM) Pods
Electronic Countermeasure pods can be mounted to the centerline
station under the fuselage or stations 3 or 7 under the wings. These
defensive systems provide an additional layer of protection against
radar threats such as surface-to-air missile (SAM) batteries.
Depending on the sophistication and range of the radar system that
is attempting to acquire and track the aircraft, ECM pods can be
used to deny, degrade or delay an attack so that the pilot can
escape the engagement envelope of the threat system, evade
incoming weapons, or gain additional time to execute their mission
before being forced to take evasive maneuvers..                           ALQ-131 (Northrop Grumman)

AN/ALQ-131. The ALQ-131 is one of the most proliferated self-protection aircraft-mounted ECM systems to
date. The system can employ both barrage (“noise”) jamming as well as deception jamming to threat radar
systems across multiple frequency bands.
AN/ALQ-184. The ALQ-184 was developed in the 1980’s as an upgrade to the 1970’s-era ALQ-119. The ALQ-
184 uses the same pod as the ALQ-119 but features higher jamming power output, lower response time to threat
radar signals, and digital microprocessors to increase its capability against threat radar systems.
AN/ALQ-184 Long. The “Long” version of the ALQ-184 includes additional modules to provide protection
against additional radar frequency bands.
(See Electronic Countermeasures for more information.)


AN/ASQ-T50 Tactical Combat Training System (TCTS) Pod
The AN/ASQ-T50 is a Tactical Combat Training System device. It
incorporates a sensor platform and datalink transceiver, allowing it
to record and transmit real-time aircraft telemetry to monitoring
stations. TCTS pods are used during training exercises to monitor
and record aircraft positions for many purposes, including
debriefing analysis.
The TCTS pod is captive and cannot be released. It can be mounted
to either outboard underwing pylon, or either wingtip station.


                                                                                      USAF


MXU-648 Travel Pod
The MXU-648 is a travel pod, used to transport equipment or the
pilot’s belongings when the aircraft is repositioned. The MXU-648
has a maximum load capacity of 300 pounds, and an internal
volume of 4.75 cubic feet.
The MXU-648 can be mounted on any air-to-ground pylon.
