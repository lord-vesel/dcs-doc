AIRCRAFT HISTORY
The history of the F-16 is closely linked to the history of fly-by-wire. Fly-by-wire substitutes the traditional
hydromechanical link between pilot and control surfaces for a computer. When the pilot moves the stick left,
they are essentially telling the fly-by-wire computer that they wish to bank left; it’s then up to the computer to
decide how to translate that command into a series of control surface deflections. Fly-by-wire opened the door
to aircraft designed with relaxed static stability: designs that would be too unstable for a human pilot to fly
manually, but whose instability translated to improved maneuverability.
The F-16’s pioneering fly-by-wire system is owed to a man named Harry Hillaker. In the 1940s, fresh out of
college, Hillaker joined Consolidated Aircraft as an aircraft designer. There Hillaker contributed to the designs of
the B-36 Peacemaker and the F-111, among others, and in doing so, he began to lament a trend among Air
Force aircraft: Each new generation was becoming bigger, heavier, and less efficient. By the mid-1960s,
Hillaker started contemplating a small, agile fighter that forsook contemporary Air Force dogma.
While Hillaker pondered his new fighter, NASA was breaking
ground on fly-by-wire technology. Fly-by-wire was first used on
the Gemini 2 capsule, and ultimately made its way to the Apollo
lunar landers, where it impressed astronaut Neil Armstrong.
Following the cancellation of the Apollo program, Armstrong was
promoted to Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics at
NASA. Wanting to further investigate fly-by-wire technology,
Armstrong acquired a lunar lander computer, and had it installed
in an F-8 Crusader, to be used as a testbed for airborne fly-by-
wire. This F-8, designated NASA 802, flew in May of 1972, thus
becoming the United States’s first fly-by-wire aircraft. NASA 802
caught the notice of Hillaker, who noted the drastic improvement
in control responsiveness, a full 2.5 times that of an unmodified
F-8.

The Fighter Mafia
                             Few fighter pilots are as well-known (or notorious) as Col. John Boyd. Following a
                             1953 tour in Korea as an F-86 Sabre pilot, Boyd attended the USAF Fighter
                             Weapons School, where he quickly became a star pupil. His outstanding
                             performance earned him an invite to return as an instructor, and through the
                             1960s, Boyd worked as teacher and tactician, conceiving of and developing his
                             energy-maneuverability theory. E-M theory was an entirely novel analysis of
                             aircraft combat, with a quantifiable underpinning contributed by mathematician
                             Thomas Christie. Boyd and Christie crunched the numbers using Air Force
                             computers, and the results led Boyd to the conclusion that a fighter with maximal
                             thrust-to-weight ratio and minimal energy loss in turns would hold a competitive
                             advantage over contemporary designs, which emphasized bigger, heavier engines
                             and airframes.
                            In the late 1960s, in an effort to continue to push his ideas, Boyd put together a
     Col. John Boyd (US)    team of likeminded experts: The “Fighter Mafia.” Among them was Harry Hillaker of
                           Consolidated Aircraft, which had since been sold to General Dynamics. The Fighter
Mafia worked from inside the Air Force to advance the concept of a lightweight fighter.
In 1967, Boyd was recalled to USAF headquarters to apply his E-M theory to the flagging F-X project. The F-X
project was to be the next generation USAF fighter aircraft, but it had stalled amidst doubts among USAF
generals that it had become too large and costly. Boyd’s analyses helped convince the Air Force to reduce the
weight and complexity of the F-X. The lighter F-X proposal would be nicknamed the F-X “Blue Bird,” but Boyd
and the Fighter Mafia continued to push for an even smaller, even more nimble air superiority fighter, which
they called the F-X “Red Bird.”
The Fighter Mafia was a diverse group of fighter pilots and engineers, but they all had in common a desire to
see the Air Force adopt a lightweight fighter design. This put them squarely at odds with the Air Force brass,
most of whom leaned heavily on the upcoming “Blue Bird.” The F-
X program was seen as a sort of rebirth for the USAF fighter
inventory, at this time comprised mostly of F-111s and F-4s. The
F-111 had by then evolved into something ungainly and sluggish,
and the F-4 was thought of as the Navy’s bird, something the Air
Force adopted only afterwards. The F-X represented a prideful
Air Force future, embracing its “higher, faster, further” motto, and
many in the USAF command ranks were emotionally invested in
an aircraft that embodied those words.
The F-X program continued undeterred. In 1970, the Air Force
announced that McDonnell-Douglas was selected to develop the                        F-15 Eagle (USAF)
F-X, now designated the F-15 Eagle.


Lightweight Fighter Program
Towards the end of the 1960s, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, David Packard (of Hewlett-Packard) had
become concerned that the upcoming USAF and Navy frontline fighters — the F-15 and the F-14 Tomcat —
represented future budget problems for the Armed Forces. The Fighter Mafia had continued to push the USAF
towards their “Red Bird” concept, now also known as the F-XX. Their studies also helped convince
manufacturers such as General Dynamics and Northrop to start investigating potential lightweight fighter
designs. In late 1970, as the F-14 continued to experience budget and maintenance issues, Lockheed-Martin
took the initiative and delivered to Packard an unsolicited proposal for a lightweight fighter. Other companies in
the industry quickly followed suit, including General Dynamics.
                        Deputy SecD Packard had been looking to implement a new “fly-before-you-buy”
                        purchasing policy and had become recently enamored of competitive prototyping. He
                        saw the new LWF proposals to advance his ideas. The Air Force was still lukewarm to
                        the idea of a lightweight fighter, until the Fighter Mafia coined the “high/low mix” — the
                        concept that the F-15 and F-XX would complement each other, occupying the high-cost
                        and low-cost brackets of Air Force spending, respectively. The high/low mix idea
                        reframed the LWF as an ally to the F-15, and lifted resistance among Air Force brass.
                     Packard’s Lightweight Fighter RFP produced five proposals, among which two were
                     selected for funding: The General Dynamics Model 401, and the Northrop P-600. Each
                     company would be granted funding to build demonstrator aircraft, which would be
 David Packard (DoD) tested against each other in a series of trials — the fingerprint of Deputy SecD
                     Packard’s influence. The P-600 would be redesignated the YF-17, and the Model 401
would become the YF-16.


Air Combat Fighter Competition
At General Dynamics, Robert. H Widmer became the chief engineer on the YF-16 project. At Harry Hillaker’s
insistence, the YF-16 was to incorporate a production fly-by-wire system — but as the engineers were still
uncertain if fly-by-wire was feasible, the YF-16 program was designed with a contingency. Should it be
necessary, the YF-16’s wings could be shifted aftward to restore the airframe’s static stability, and the analog
fly-by-wire system was designed to be easily removable and replaced with traditional flight controls.
                                               Along with its revolutionary control system, the YF-16 became a
                                               testbed for other innovations: The aircraft would be capable of 9-g
                                               maneuvers, and the seat was reclined 30° to improve the pilot’s g-
                                               tolerance. The reclined seat, and concern about the pilot’s ability to
                                               manipulate systems during high-g maneuvering, guided the
                                               development of its HOTAS, which put more capability on the stick
                                               and throttle than prior aircraft. The small cockpit necessitated that
                                               the stick be moved to the side, so that it wouldn’t obscure cockpit
                                               instruments.
                                               In December 1973, the completed YF-16 prototype was unveiled at
                                               Edwards Air Force Flight Test Center, where it began flight trials.
                                               Its first flight on January 20, 1974 was unintended: During a fast-
                                               taxi run, a fault in the fly-by-wire system created a worsening
           YF-16 Rollout, 1973 (GD)            control problem that forced the test pilot to lift off for a trip around
                                               the pattern. The actual, intended first flight occurred a few weeks
later in February, following repairs of the prototype.
The Air Force had set the initial stakes of the LWF competition by committing to purchasing 650 aircraft of
whichever model won. But by early 1974, interest in the Lightweight Fighter competition had grown, and as
word spread to NATO allies, other countries began committing to purchases of the winner as well. In response
to the heightened interest, the LWF competition was expanded into a new program called Air Combat Fighter
(ACF). The ACF program specified a multirole lightweight fighter aircraft and required that any purchase of the
winning model must also be in parallel to a purchase of F-15s. This requirement shut down the last of the
resistance to the LWF program within the Air Force.
The expanded ACF program brought in foreign competitors, among them Dassault-Breguet, SEPECAT, and
Saab. Ultimately, after flying 330 trial sorties spanning 417 flight hours, test pilots unanimously favored the YF-
16. So it was January 13, 1975 when Secretary of the Air Force John L. McLucas announced that General
Dynamics had won the ACF competition, and with it, hundreds of domestic and foreign orders for the F-16.


The F-16A and B
Through 1974 and 1975, General Dynamics developed the YF-
16 into the F-16, making numerous structural modifications. What
was originally envisioned as Boyd’s lightweight fighter now had to
become a multirole aircraft, per the ACF program requirements.
The radome was enlarged to fit the AN/APG-68 radar, and two
more pylons were added. These and other changes ultimately
netted a 25% weight increase.
So much was the Air Force’s desire to keep the new fighter from
impinging on the F-15’s glory, that Air Force brass prohibited the
F-16 from carrying AIM-7 Sparrows, the medium-range BVR
missile of the day. (This requirement would impel one of the
Fighter Mafia, General Mike Loh, to order the design of a
medium-range missile that could be mounted on AIM-9
                                                                              First production F-16A bl.10 (USAF)
Sidewinder stations — a project that would ultimately produce the
AIM-120 AMRAAM.)
In late 1975, the first F-16A FSD (full-scale development) was manufactured, and on October 20, 1978, the first
production model rolled off the assembly line. The production F-16A first flew in November of that year, and the
Air Force received its first delivery in January. The F-16 entered operational service with the 388th Tactical
Fighter Squadron at Hill AFB, Utah in 1979. A year later, the F-16 was given the official moniker of “Fighting
Falcon” — but of course, its pilots called it the “Viper.”
In all, 475 F-16As and Bs (dual-seat variant) were produced. The model variant spanned blocks 1, 5, 10, 15,
and 20. Many Block 20 F-16As have since undergone the Mid-Life Upgrade (MLU), becoming functionally
equivalent to F-16Cs.


The F-16C and D
On June 12, 1987, the block 30 F-16 was introduced, designated the F-16C and D. Block 30 was the result of
the Alternative Fighter Engine (AFE) program, a project to allow the F-16 to be configured with either the
existing Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220 engine, or with the General Electric F110-GE-100 as an alternative. The
original plan was for the F-16 to have a common engine bay, allowing any aircraft to swap between the two
engines. This idea was scrapped when it was discovered that the GE engine required widening the inlet. Due to
the airframe change, beginning with block 30, the blocks were split in two: The 30, 40, 50, and 70 blocks were
equipped with a GE engine, and the 32, 42, 52, and 72 blocks had a P&W.
Along with the diversity of engine choices, the block 30/32 Viper received an upgraded mission computer with
more storage, an AN/ALE-47 countermeasures dispenser, and the capability to employ AGM-45 Shrike and
AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles.
Block 30/32 F-16s would be delivered to the USAF Thunderbirds demonstration squadron in 1986 and 1987;
these aircraft are today some of the oldest still-operating F-16s. Other block-30/32s were delivered to the US
Navy, re-designated the F-16N, and used as stripped-down aggressor aircraft in USN air combat training.
                                             The block 40/42 model, commonly called the “Night Falcon,” was
                                             debuted in December 1988. As implied by its nickname, the Night
                                             Falcon introduced a suite of night attack technologies, including the
                                             LANTIRN navigation and targeting pods, and terrain-following
                                             radar. The aircraft also got an upgraded fire control radar and
                                             RWR, a holographic HUD capable of displaying FLIR video, and an
                                             improved mission computer. The aircraft got an exterior makeover
                                             as well: The hull was treated with radar-absorbent materials, and
                                             the iconic gold-tinted canopy debuted. Despite all these
                                             improvements, the USAF was in general disappointed with the
    F-16C (MSGT Michael Ammons, USAF)        increased weight and decreased performance of the Night Falcon
                                            series.
January 1991 saw the start of Operation Desert Storm in Iraq, and with it, the F-16’s first combat deployment for
the USAF. On December 27, 1992, LTC Gary North of 33rd Tactical Fighter Squadron earned the first combat
kill in a USAF F-16 after shooting down a Syrian MiG-25 that violated airspace restrictions. The MiG-25 was
also the first aircraft destroyed by an AIM-120 AMRAAM.
In October of 1991, block 50/52 rolled out, restoring the Viper’s performance and maneuverability. The aircraft
got an up-rated engine (the F110-GE-129 or the F100-PW-229), and with it a 20% increase in thrust. The radar
was again upgraded, integrated datalink modem (IDM) support was added, and the block-40’s holographic HUD
was replaced with the original block-30 HUD. Some block 50 Vipers were configured to carry the advanced
HARM Targeting System (HTS) pod; these SEAD aircraft were designated the F-16CJ and DJ.
The F-16C continues to see improvements and upgrades to keep it in step with technological innovations.
Between 2003 and 2010, the Air Force’s Common Configuration Implementation Program (CCIP) modernized
and standardized the avionics and capabilities across the fleet of block-40 and block-50 F-16Cs. The FCC was
upgraded, the MFDs were replaced with new color displays, support for JHMCS and Link 16 was added, and
the IFF was modernized. F-16CJ and DJ SEAD models that underwent modernization through this program
were redesignated the F-16CM or DM.
                                        Today, while the USAF no longer purchases F-16s, it still operates a
                                        fleet of over 1,000 active-duty F-16Cs and Ds. F-16s have served in
                                        virtually every US air combat action since Operation Desert Storm, and
                                        F-16s are scheduled to continue to remain in service until 2025, when
                                        they will be replaced with the F-35A Lightning II.
                                         Aside from the US, twenty-six other countries have purchased or leased
                                         F-16s, and all but one (Italy) continue to fly them as an integral part of
                                         their air forces. After purchasing General Dynamics, Lockheed-Martin
             F-16V (L-M)                 continues to improve on the F-16 for foreign customers. The United Arab
                                       Emirates funded development of the F-16E and F models (block 60), and
many other countries have pledged to purchase the upcoming F-16V (block 70/72). The V model is expected to
be delivered to buyers starting in 2023.
F-16C STORES
M61A1 Vulcan 20mm Cannon
The F-16 is equipped with an M61 Vulcan internal cannon. The M61 fires
standard M50 20mm rounds at 6,000 rounds per minute. It is effective
against both surface and air targets. The ammunition drum carries 510
rounds.
In DCS, you can load the following ammunition types:
HEI. High-explosive incendiary rounds. HEI rounds have both explosive
and incendiary effects, making them effective against personnel and light
vehicles.
HEI-T. High-explosive incendiary rounds with tracer mix. Tracer rounds
are substituted for HEI rounds at regular intervals. The tracer rounds
glow brightly when fired, allowing the pilot to visually see the ballistic path      Allspamme (CC-SA)
of the fired projectiles.
AP. Armor-piercing rounds. Armor-piercing rounds are made from depleted uranium, making them able to
penetrate many layers of armor. They have no incendiary or explosive effects upon impact, and as such as less
effective against personnel.
TP. Target practice rounds. TP rounds are inert with only kinetic effects upon impact. TP mix always contains
tracer rounds at regular intervals.
SAPHEI. Semi-armor piercing high-explosive incendiary rounds. These rounds have both incendiary/explosive
effects and armor-piercing capability. The rounds are constructed such that the incendiary and explosive effects
are triggered after penetration of the armor. SAPHEI rounds are effective against a wide range of vehicles but
are not generally effective against personnel.


AIM-9 Sidewinder
The AIM-9 Sidewinder is an infrared-guided (heat-seeking) short-range air-
to-air missile. It first entered service in 1956 and has since become one of
the most successful missiles in the West. Its longevity is thanks to its
versatility and continued improvement over multiple generations.
The AIM-9 uses an array of up to five scanning infrared sensors, cooled by
an internal argon bottle (L and M models). The Sidewinder has a maximum
speed of over Mach 2.5 and a maximum range of around 10 to 20 miles,
depending on the variant. Minimum range is around 3,000 feet.                        David Monniaux (CC-BY-SA)

A single AIM-9 can be mounted on any of the F-16’s air-to-air stations.
AIM-9L Sidewinder. The 1977 “Lima” model was the first all-aspect Sidewinder, meaning it no longer required
the target to present a rear profile. The AIM-9L earned its first kill when it struck a Libyan Su-22, after being
fired from an F-14 Tomcat, in the infamous Gulf of Sidra engagement of 1981.
AIM-9M Sidewinder. The 1982 “Mike” model improved on the Guidance Control Section (GCS). Susceptibility
to flares was reduced, and background discrimination was improved, resulting in a greater chance of lock-on.
The motor’s smoke signature was reduced, making the missile less likely to be detected.
AIM-9X Sidewinder. The 2003 “X-ray” model is the latest iteration of the Sidewinder. The X-ray adds high off-
boresight (HOBS) capability and the ability to slave the seeker head to the JHMCS. The missile’s
maneuverability was boosted with all-axis thrust-vectoring capability. These changes allow the pilot to simply
“point their head and shoot” in nearly any direction, and the missile will make its way to the target. The infrared
sensor was replaced with focal-plane arrays (FPAs) and counter-countermeasures capability was improved
further. Electronic fuzing was added to reduce minimum range.
CAP-9M. Captive variant of the AIM-9M. The captive variant has the same size, weight, and drag
characteristics as the AIM-9M, for training effectiveness. It also contains an integrated infrared sensor and will
provide audio and visual guidance cues to the pilot, but it does not have a motor and does not release from the
aircraft.


AIM-120 AMRAAM
The AIM-120 AMRAAM is an active radar homing (ARH) medium-
range air-to-air missile. First introduced in 1982, the AMRAAM was
intended to replace the semi-active radar homing AIM-7 Sparrow,
which was the medium-range BVR missile in the US inventory at
the time.
The AIM-120 uses both command guidance and radar homing to
reach its target. The AIM-120’s integral radar has a comparatively
short range, and so until the missile is within that range, it is guided
by datalink commands sent automatically from the launching
aircraft. The AMRAAM has a maximum speed around Mach 4 and
a maximum range of 30 to 40 miles.                                                    SCDBob (CC-SA)

AIM-120B AMRAAM. This 1994 variant is the earliest variant still in production.
AIM-120C AMRAAM. The 1996 variant improved target detection, homing capability, and fuzing.


AGM-88 HARM
The AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) is a passive
radar homing air-to-ground missile used in the suppression of enemy
air defenses (SEAD) role. The HARM has a radar receiver and
processor that detects and identifies signals from enemy surface
radars. When launched, it can guide to the target by homing on its
specific radar emissions. The missile also has an inertial guidance
system to provide mid-course guidance prior to detection of the radar
signal (or if the signal is lost).
The AGM-88 has a maximum speed of Mach 1.84 and an operational
range of around 80 nautical miles. It uses a laser proximity fuze for
detonation.
                                                                                    SSGT Scott Stewart (USAF)
AGM-88C. This mid-1980s variant incorporates field-reprogrammable
software and improved guidance and fuzing.
AGM-65 Maverick
The AGM-65 Maverick is a medium-range air-to-ground missile
designed for the close air support role. The AGM-65 family contains
a diverse set of variants and guidance systems, including infrared,
electro-optical, and laser guidance.
The AGM-65 has a maximum range of around 13 nautical miles. It
was first delivered in 1972. A single Maverick can be mounted to an
LAU-117 rack, or up to 3 can be carried on an LAU-88 rack.
AGM-65D Maverick. The D model contains an imaging infrared
sensor and guidance system. The sensor can locate and tracking
targets during daylight and night, in clear or restricted-visibility            SSGT Glenn B. Lindsey (USAF)
weather conditions. It contains a 126-pound shaped-charge warhead.
AGM-65G Maverick. The G model has the same guidance system as the D model, but with a larger 300-pound
penetrating warhead, making it more effective against hardened targets.
AGM-65H Maverick. The H model uses a digital CCD sensor, making it effective in daylight only. The H model
is capable of forced correlation and does not require a target centroid to track. It contains a 126-pound shaped-
charge warhead.
AGM-65K Maverick. The K model has the same guidance system as the H model, but with a larger 300-pound
penetrating warhead.


CBU-87 CEM
The CBU-97 Combined Effects Munitions (CEM) is an unguided cluster
bomb. It was first developed in 1986. Each bomb contains an SUU-
65/B canister and 202 submunitions. The submunitions have both
fragmentation and incendiary effects and are effective against both
vehicles and personnel.
After being released, the CBU-87 begins spinning. It falls to a
preprogrammed burst altitude, at which point the canister separates
and the submunitions are dispersed.
The CBU-87 can be mounted directly to any air-to-ground pylon, or up
to three can be mounted on a TER-9A triple ejector rack.
                                                                                   SRA Edward Braly (USAF)


CBU-97 SFW
The CBU-97 Sensor Fuzed Weapon (SFW) is an unguided cluster
bomb containing target-discriminating submunitions. Each bomb
contains a SUU-66/B canister and 10 BLU-108 submunitions. When the
bomb approaches its preprogrammed burst altitude, the canister opens
and all 10 submunitions are released. The submunitions deploy
parachutes at preprogrammed intervals to increase lateral spacing.
Once the submunitions reach the burst altitude, the parachute is
separated, and a rocket motor spins the submunition and stops its
descent. Each submunition contains four “skeets,” which are then                      Cindy Farmer (US)
released in four different directions.
The skeets have ground-facing laser and infrared sensors. Both sensors are used to detect the presence of a
vehicle. When a vehicle is detected, the skeet detonates, firing an explosively formed projectile (EFP)
downward toward the vehicle. The EFP strikes the radiative part of the vehicle (usually the engine) and
penetrates its armor at high speed.
The skeets do not detonate if a vehicle is not detected, instead self-destructing before reaching the ground. This
helps reduce collateral casualties associated with the use of cluster munitions.
The CBU-97 can be mounted directly to any air-to-ground pylon, or up to three can be mounted on a TER-9A
triple ejector rack.


Paveway II Laser Guided Bomb
The Paveway II is a series of laser-guided bombs based on
conventional general-purpose bombs. The guidance kit consists of a
laser detector and processor in the front and a set of steering fins in the
back. The bomb detects and tracks reflected laser energy off a target.
The laser designation can come from the launching aircraft, another
aircraft (“buddy lasing”), or from a laser-capable ground unit such as a
JTAC.
The Paveway II series was introduced in the early 1970s to replace the
first-generation Paveway series of laser-guided bombs. The Paveway II
improved sensor reliability and added extendible rear fins to extend                 SSGT Glenn B. Lindsey (USAF)
glide range. The Paveway II series uses “bang-bang” control (where the
fins can only deflect fully in either direction), limiting its maximum range and forcing it to follow a sinusoidal path
to the target.
The Paveway II series of weapons can be mounted on any air-to-ground pylon. The GBU-12 can be mounted in
pairs using a TER-9A triple ejector rack.
GBU-12. Paveway II bomb based on the Mk. 82, a 500-pound conventional bomb.
GBU-10. Paveway II bomb based on the Mk. 84, a 2,000-pound conventional bomb.


Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM)
JDAM is an inertial and GPS guidance kit that can be applied to a
general-purpose bomb. When equipped with a JDAM kit, the
bomb can attack a pinpoint target based on coordinates
downloaded from the aircraft. It is not capable of post-launch
redesignation or attacking moving targets. JDAM precision is not
degraded by weather and is completely fire-and-forget.
JDAM development began in 1992 from a proposal for an
adverse-weather precision-guided munition. The proposal was
created in response to degraded laser-guided bomb performance
during Operation Desert Storm. The first JDAM kits were
delivered to the US military in 1997, and the first employment
was from a B-2 during Operation Allied Force.                                   SMSGT Edward E. Snyder (USAF)

GBU-38. Mk. 82 500-pound bomb with JDAM guidance kit.

GBU-31(V)3/B. BLU-109 2,000-pound hardened penetration bomb with JDAM guidance kit.
AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW)
JSOW is an inertially-aided glide bomb with exceptional glide
range due to its folding wings. Like JDAM, JSOW can attack
pinpoint targets using pre-designated GPS coordinates. JSOW
precision is not degraded by weather and the bomb is
completely fire-and-forget.
JSOW entered service in January 1999. Range is dependent on
launch parameters, especially the altitude and speed of the
aircraft at release. For high-altitude launches, the bomb can
glide as far as 70 nautical miles.
AGM-154A. The baseline AGM-154 variant consists of 145 BLU-
97/B combined effects submunitions, with both armor-piercing
and incendiary effects. These submunitions are identical to the              TSGT Cary Humphries, USAF
ones used in the CBU-97. The AGM-154A cannot be re-targeted
after launch.


Wind-Corrected Munitions Dispensers (WCMD)
WCMD (pronounced “wick-mid”) is a tail kit for the CBU-87 and
CBU-97 cluster weapons. When equipped with WCMD, these
munitions become precision-guided. The tail kit includes an
integrated INS which is initialized from the aircraft’s onboard GPS
position just before release. The WCMD guidance system can also
be programmed with the winds aloft to enhance accuracy, giving it
down to an 85-foot circular error probable (CEP).
CBU-103. CBU-87 Combined Effects Munition (CEM) equipped
with WCMD.
CBU-105. CBU-97 Sensor-Fuzed Weapon (SFW) equipped with

Mark 80-Series General-Purpose Bomb
The Mk. 80-series of general-purpose bombs is a series of unguided
bombs dating back to the Vietnam War. The bombs come in nominal
weights of 500, 1,000, and 2,000 pounds. The bombs are very versatile,
and they can be fitted with both nose and tail fuzes, as well as different
guidance kits.
GP bombs can be fitted to any air-to-ground pylon. The Mk. 82 can also
be mounted to a triple ejector rack (the TER-9A) in pairs or triples.
Mk. 82. A general-purpose bomb with a nominal weight of 500 pounds.
                                                                                 SSGT Randy Mallard (USAF)
Mk. 82 Snakeye. A Mk. 82 with retarding petals that extend after
release. The petals reduce the bomb’s downrange speed after release, allowing aircraft to perform low-level
straight-through deliveries at lower altitudes without risk of frag damage.
Mk. 82 AIR. A Mk. 82 with an Air Inflatable Retarder (AIR). The AIR is a ballute that expands after release,
performing the same retarding function as the Snakeye. The AIR is a newer technology and is more effective
than the Snakeye, making the bomb safe to use at higher speeds than the Snakeye.
Mk. 84. A general-purpose bomb with a nominal weight of 2,000 pounds.


Rockets
The LAU-3 is a rocket pod that can carry up to 19 folding-fin aerial rockets
(FFARs). It is designed to carry Hydra 70mm FFARs but can carry any 70mm
rocket. The Hydra 70 is a versatile rocket that accepts many different types of
explosives and fuzes. The LAU-3 can be loaded on any air-to-ground pylon.
In DCS, you can load the following FFAR variants:
MK151 HE. A high-explosive warhead with fragmentation effects, effective
against personnel and light vehicles.
MK156 WP. A non-lethal white phosphorous warhead that creates a smoke
effect when loaded. Used for aerial target designation.                             BrokenSphere (CC-BY-SA)
MK5 HEAT. A high-explosive anti-tank warhead that has both fragmentation
and armor piercing effects, usable against personnel and most vehicles.
MK61 WP. A white phosphorous warhead intended for training use.
WTU-1/B WP. A white phosphorous warhead intended for training use.


Fuel Tanks
External fuel tanks carry additional fuel to increase the F-16’s range and
combat radius. Like most munitions, the fuel tanks are capable of being
jettisoned when needed. The external tanks can be refueled during air-to-air
refueling. The weight of the tank depends on the amount of fuel carried.
370-gallon tank. The 370-gallon variant adds approximately 2,500 pounds of
fuel. It can be carried on pylons 3 and 7.
300-gallon tank. The 300-gallon variant adds approximately 2,000 pounds of
fuel. It can only be carried on pylon 5.
                                                                                     SMSGT Edward E. Snyder
                                                                                            (USAF)

AN/AAQ-28 LITENING II Targeting Pod
The AN/AAQ-28 LITENING II is an electro-optical and infrared targeting pod that can be attached to the right
chin hardpoint on the F-16. It includes a steerable camera with a wide zoom range, capable of daylight and
nighttime target detection and laser designation.
To learn how to use the LITENING II, see LITENING AT Targeting Pod.


BDU-33
The BDU-33 is an inert, releasable training munition with the same weight and drag profile as the Mk. 82
general-purpose bomb. Upon impact, the BDU-33 releases a smoke cloud that can be used to identify the
impact point.
The BDU-33 can be loaded in sets of three on the TER-9A triple ejector rack.
AN/ASQ-T50 TCTS Pod
The AN/ASQ-T50 is a Tactical Combat Training System (TCTS) pod. It incorporates a sensor platform and
datalink transceiver, allowing it to record and transmit real-time aircraft telemetry to monitoring stations. TCTS
pods are used during training exercises to monitor and record aircraft positions, for many purposes, including
debriefing analysis.
The TCTS pod is captive and cannot be released. It can be mounted to either outboard wingtip station.


MXU-648 Travel Pod
The MXU-648 is a travel pod, used to transport equipment or the pilot’s belongings when the aircraft is
repositioned. The MXU-648 has a maximum load capacity of 300 pounds, and an internal volume of 4.75 cubic
feet.
The MXU-648 can be mounted on any air-to-ground pylon.
COCKPIT OVERVIEW
Once in the cockpit, it’s best to have a general understanding of where the various controls are located. To help
locate items more easily, we have broken the cockpit into five primary areas: Left Console, the Left Auxiliary
Console, the Instrument Panel, the Right Auxiliary Console, and the Right Console.
We will reference these locations in later sections of this manual.

                         Attitude Director Indicator

                          Horizontal Situation Indicator




Head-Up Display (HUD)
The HUD provides flight symbols relating to attack, navigation, weapon, aiming, and landing modes. It also
provides symbols for essential aircraft performance data including altitude, airspeed, attitude, and heading.


AoA Indexer
The angle of attack indexer consists of three lights. If the top light is illuminated with a red chevron, you are
above 14° of angle attack and you are pulling with an energy depleting angle of attack. If the center, green circle
is illuminated, your angle of attack is between 11 and 13 degrees and you are on-speed with optimal angle of
attack; and if the lower light with an amber chevron is illuminated, your angle of attack is below 11° and you are
energy gaining with an angle of attack less than optimum. This is duplicated on the angle of attack gauge on the
instrument panel and the angle of attack bracket on the HUD, which is only visible with the gear down.
When landing, you will be shooting for between 11 and 13 degrees of AoA. Also note that these lights are
always on, not just with gear down.


AR Status/NWS Indicator
The center NWS light illuminates green when nosewheel steering is engaged. When engaged, rudder pedal
movement allows steering of the nosewheel. When performing aerial refueling the top ready light is blue and
indicates the door is open and ready, the middle AR light is green when the refueling boom is latched, and the
bottom disconnect light is displayed when a disconnect occurs.
Integrated Control Panel (ICP)
The integrated control panel, or ICP, fills the top portion of the center instrument panel and is one of the core
systems of the communications, navigation, and IFF, or CNI, in the Viper. This is covered in its own section
below.


Data Entry Display
The data entry display, or DED, provides a display of communication, navigation aids, and identification, termed
CNI, and weapon delivery related information. Manipulation of the DED is done with the ICP.


RWR Prime Control Panel/Azimuth Display
The ALR-56M threat warning azimuth indicator is the radar warning receiver scope in the Viper. It is a plan-form
design with your aircraft in the center and emitters projected 360° around it. To the left of the scope are the
threat warning indicator lights.


Eyebrow Lights
IFF Identification Light. Pressing the IFF identification button initiates and IFF response to an interrogation or
request from air traffic control.
Fault Acknowledge Light. When a fault appears on the Pilot Fault List Display, or PFLD, the fault
acknowledge button is pressed to clear the fault.
Master Caution Light. The master caution light will illuminate anytime a caution light is lit to indicate
malfunction or specific condition has occurred. It can be reset by pressing on the light button.


Left and Right Multifunction Display (MFD)
The left multifunction display, or MFD, consists of a full color CRT screen with 20 surrounding option select
buttons, or OSBs, in four groups of five. At the corners of the MFD are rocker switches for display gain, symbol
brightness, contrast, and display brightness.


Miscellaneous (MISC) Panel
Autopilot Roll and Pitch Switches. The two autopilot switches allow you to set pitch and roll. The pitch switch
can be set to ALT HOLD to maintain the current altitude, the A/P OFF setting turns it off, and the ATT HOLD
setting sets the aircraft to maintain the current pitch/roll attitude. The roll switch includes the HDG SEL setting to
have the aircraft turn to and maintain the heading selected with the bug on the HSI, ATT HOLD maintains the
current roll/pitch attitude, and STRNG SEL directs the autopilot to steer to the selected steerpoint on the DED.
Both switches can be used in unison.
ADV Mode Switch. The terrain avoidance button here is for terrain following radar and not used in the Block 50
Viper.
Master Arm Switch. The master arm switch has three positions. In the off position, weapons release is
inhibited except for an emergency jettison. In ARM and SIMULATE the radar and store management system
operate normally, but no weapons can be released in SIMULATE. SIM mode is normally used in training to get
weapons symbology without actual release/launch, except for an emergency jettison.
ALT Release Button. The alt release button functions as a backup to the weapons release button on the
control stick in case of its malfunction.
Laser Arm Switch. If a targeting pod is loaded, the laser arm switch arms the laser.
ECM Enable Light. When ECM is transmitting, the ECM light will illuminate.
RF Switch. The radio frequency, or RF, switch, is a three-position switch that allows you to control emissions
from your aircraft. When set to silent, all electronic signals for the aircraft are disabled, to include the radar,
radar altimeter, data link, TACAN transmit, and ECM. In quiet mode though, the radar, TACAN, and data link
transmit but all other emissions are inhibited.


Warning Lights
Engine and Engine Fire Warning Lights. Along the right eyebrow are a series of split emergency lights that
often require immediate action when illuminated. The Engine light will illuminate when RPM and FTIT indicator
signals indicate an over-temperature, flameout, or stagnation has occurred. This means an RPM of less than 60
percent or an FTIT of 1000 Celsius or more. The Engine Fire light illuminates if a fire is detected in the engine
bay.
Hydraulic and Oil Pressure Warning Light. Both the hydraulic and oil pressure lights will illuminate if the oil
pressure falls below 10 psi for more than 30 seconds, or if either the A or B hydraulic system is below 1000 psi.
FLCS and DBU Warning Lights. The FLCS warning light illuminates if a malfunction is detected with the FLCS
processors, power supplies, input commands or sensors, angle of attack, or air data inputs. It will also illuminate
if the leading-edge flaps are locked, or built-in test fails. The DBU light will illuminate if the FLCS digital back up
is enabled.
Takeoff and Landing Configuration Warning Lights. The takeoff and landing configuration light illuminates if
the landing gear is not down when the aircraft is below 10,000 feet, the airspeed is less than 190 knots, and the
descent rate is greater than 250 feet per minute. This will also correspond to the landing gear intermittent horn
sound.
Canopy and Oxygen Low Warning Lights. The canopy light is lit when the canopy is not down and locked
and the low oxygen light will illuminate if the oxygen system is below 5 PSI or there is a BIT test failure.


Engine Instruments
Oil Pressure Indicator. The engine is equipped with a self-contained oil system to lubricate the engine and
gear box. The indicator reads between 0 and 100 PSI. Normal idle throttle PSI is around 15 when on the ground
and 60 when at military power and above.
Engine Nozzle Position Indicator. The engine nozzle is variable and consists of two sections, the divergent
nozzle that moves freely in conjunction with the nozzle. The nozzle is opened and closed by four hydraulic
actuators and the percentage the nozzle is open is indicted by this gauge.
Engine RPM Indicator. The RPM indicator indicates engine RPM as supplied by the engine alternator. It’s
expressed as a percentage value of 1 to 110.
FTIT Indicator. The Fan Turbine Inlet Temperature, or FTIT, indicates an average temperature in degrees
Celsius, and it can range from 200 to 1200 degrees in increments of 100.
Airspeed and Mach Indicator
The Airspeed and Mach indicator is pneumatically powered by the pitot-static system. Airspeed is indicated by
the outside gauge and pointer between 80 and 850 knots, and Mach is indicated in the window near the top of
the indicator between 0.5 and 2.2 Mach. The red triangle on the indicator indicates the VNE, or velocity never
exceed.


Altimeter
The altimeter is servo-pneumatic that can indicate altitudes between negative 1,000 to plus 80,000 feet. It has
both a primary electrically powered mode and a secondary pneumatic mode. If in secondary mode, the PNEU
flag appears on the gauge to indicate pneumatic mode.
The barometric setting knob allows you to input the desired altimeter setting, as indicated in the small window
below and to the right of the digital altimeter window.


Angle of Attack Indicator
The angle of attack indicator duplicates the same information as on the angle of attack indexer next to the HUD,
but ranges between -5° and +32°. The tape is colored to match the indexer lights next to the HUD. The bar in
the center of the tape indicates your current angle of attack in relation to the center of the tape.


Attitude Director Indicator
The attitude director indicator, or ADI, displays the aircraft’s pitch and roll attitude as supplied by the inertial
navigation system, or INS. The indicator also includes a turn rate needle in which one needle width equates to 1
to 1.2° per second turn rate and a ball, slip indicator.
The pitch trim knob can be used to adjust the sphere in relation to the aircraft symbol.
When the instrument landing system (ILS) is enabled, the ADI will also display localizer and glideslope bars with
associated off warning flags.


Vertical Velocity Indicator
The vertical velocity indicator, or VVI, displays the rate of climb or descent on a moving tape with a range of
6,000 feet per minute in a climb or dive.


Horizontal Situation Indicator
The horizontal situation indicator, or HSI, displays a plan-view with the aircraft in the center of the display. The
compass around the aircraft symbol is driven by the INS so that magnetic north is always read at the lubber
line.
The heading set knob allows you to set the heading indicators and the course knob allows you to set the
course.


Fuel Quantity Select Panel
The Fuel Quantity Select panel allows you to determine what fuel information is displayed on the fuel gauge.
    •    Test will place both pointers at 2000 pounds and the totalizer should display 6000 pounds. Both fuel
         low caution lights should illuminate.
    •    In NORM, the AL pointer indicates remaining fuel in the aft left reservoir and the A-1 fuselage tank,
         and the FR pointer indicates the sum fuel in the forward right reservoir tank and the F-1 and F-2
         fuselage tanks.
    •    Reservoir (RSVR) moves the AF and FR pointers to display fuel in the aft and forward reservoir
         tanks.
    •    Internal Wing (INT WING) moves the AF and FR pointers to display fuel in the internal left and right
         fuel tanks.
    •    External Wing (EXT WING) moves the AF and FR pointers to display fuel in the in the wing external
         fuel tanks
    •    External Centerline (EXT CTR) moves the FR pointer to indicate the centerline external fuel tank
         load.
    •    The External Fuel Transfer switch allows you control fuel transfer from the external tanks. NORM
         transfers from the centerline tank then the wing tanks. WING FIRST transfers from the wing tanks first
         then the centerline.

Miscellaneous Switches and Indicators
EMER STORES JETTISON Button. The emergency jettison button will jettison all fuel tanks, carted
suspension racks, and free fall ordnance.
WHEELS Down Lights. These show the state of the mains and nosewheel. When green, the gear is down and
locked. When the landing gear is transit, the landing gear handle will shine red and when the main/nose gear
are in the position commanded by the gear handle, its light will turn off
HOOK Switch. This switch extends the hook for emergency arrestment on airfields equipped with an
arrestment system. Once the hook is dropped though, the hook cannot be fully retracted from the cockpit.
ANTI-SKID Switch. The brake switch can be set to anti-skid or parking brake modes.
LANDING TAXI LIGHTS Switch. The landing and taxi light switch allows you to set the lights for takeoff/landing
or taxi operations.
DN LOCK REL Button. The down lock override button mechanically unlocks the spring-actuated handle lock if
the electrical solenoid should fail or not be powered. It overrides all electrical LG control signals.
LG Handle. Movement of the handle operates electrical switches to command landing gear retraction or
extension. A warning light in the LG handle illuminates when the gear and doors are in transit or have failed to
lock in the commanded position. The warning light also illuminates when all LG are not down and locked,
airspeed is less than 190 knots, altitude is less than 10,000 feet, and rate of descent is greater than 250 feet per
minute.
SPEED BRAKE Position Indicator. The speed brake indicator has three possible indications, closed, open,
and no power. When closed the indicator displays closed, when open it has a series of nine dots, and when it
has no power, it has striped lines.
STORES CONFIG Switch. The stores configuration switch has positions for CAT I and CAT III. This generally
translates to CAT 1 being air-to-air load outs and CAT III being heavier air-to-ground load outs or lots of gas
under the wings. When set to CAT III the FLCS limits the angle of attack and onset rates in order to increase
departure resistance.
HORN SILENCER Button. The landing gear horn silence button allows you to turn off the audio horn when you
get below 190 knots, below 10,000 feet, trailing flaps extended, and the landing gear is not down and locked.
This generally warns you to lower the landing year, but you may also hear it if you get slow in a dogfight below
10,000 feet MSL.
GND JETT ENABLE Switch. The OFF position inhibits emergency jettison with the landing gear down and
weight on wheels and inhibits selective jettison and normal release functions with the landing gear down. The
ENABLE position permits all arming and release conditions, regardless of landing gear or weight on wheels
conditions. This is used during maintenance operations for checkout of the aircraft armament system.
BRAKES Channel Switch. The toe brakes can be initiated by either electrical channel 1 or 2, which also
operate the brake hydraulic valves. You will normally keep this set to channel 1.


CMDS Control Panel
Controls and displays related to countermeasures dispenser set are located on this panel. Modes and programs
for chaff/flare dispensing and jammer use can be selected from here and activated using HOTAS controls on
your stick.


Threat Warning Aux Control Panel
Controls for powering up and managing the RWR are located on this panel.
ALT GEAR Handle
The alternate landing gear release handle lowers the landing gear in case of a hydraulic failure and/or inability
to lower the main landing gear handle.

Magnetic Compass
The magnetic compass is a self-contained indicator which shows the heading of the aircraft in relation to
magnetic north.


Fuel Quantity Indicator
The fuel gauge displays total remaining fuel in the digital window in pounds of fuel, and the two needles indicate
fuel in the aft and left, and forward and right. If the two needles become too divergent, indicating a fuel
imbalance, then red will be down at the base of a needle. In such a case, you would use the engine feed switch
on fuel panel to correct the imbalance.
Hydraulic Pressure Indicators for System A and B
The hydraulic pressure in the A and B systems are indicated on the two gauges. Normal operation is between
2,850 and 3,250 PSI.


Pilot Fault List Display
The Pilot Fault List Display, or PFLD, lists all FLCS detected faults. Two types of PFLDs are displayed: warning
level and caution level. Warnings are associated with the FLCS and have a bracket around them. Cautions are
associated with other FLCS elements, engine, and avionics systems. When a PFLD item is displayed, its
corresponding caution light indicator will illuminate and the and the master caution light will be lit. To clear a
PFLD fault, the fault acknowledge button is pressed.


Caution Light Panel
The caution light panel consists of multiple lights associated with possible detected fault conditions.


EPU Fuel Quantity Indicator
The EPU quantity indication shows the remaining supply of hydrazine as a percentage. At 100%, the EPU can
run for about 10-15 minutes.

                          EXT LIGHTING Control Panel   AVTR Control Panel




Test Switch Panel
This panel includes the following controls and displays:
     •       A fire and overheat detection test button that tests the overheat detection system. This then triggers
             the overheat caution light and the engine fire eyebrow light. These in turn trigger the master caution
             light.
     •       The Pitot heat power and test switch allows heating of the data probes when in the on position. When
             set to test, the probe heat caution light flashes after a good test.
     •       A test switch for the on-board oxygen generation system (OBOGS). This will trigger the low oxygen
             eyebrow light.
     •       Emergency Power Unit (EPU) test switch tests the system after engine start.
     •       An indicator light test button that tests the warning and caution lights, as well as audio voice
             messages.
     •       The flight control system (FLCS, pronounced “flick-us”) power test switch for the left and right A, B, C,
             and D light indicators for the four redundant flight control channels. Below it is the FLCS test power
             test switch, that when held to test, tests power output to the FLCS when the electrical power is first
             set to battery.
FLT Control Panel
As you might imagine, this panel allows you to set manual controls of the F-16’s flight control systems.
Normally, you don’t have to touch most of this because Viper’s flight control systems are highly automated.
     •    The Digital Back Up, or DBU switch, selects the FLCS backup software. If enabled, you will see the
          DBU caution light and a HUD warning.
     •    The Alt Flap switch allows manual trailing edge flap engagement rather than the automatic schedule.
          You would use this if you had a flap failure with asymmetric flap settings.
     •    The alternate manual TF fly-up switch is for terrain following radar, and this is not used on the Block
          50 Viper.
     •    Manual or automatic control of the leading-edge flaps is available with the LE Flaps switch. This
          allows the leading-edge flaps to be controlled based on the schedule or locked in place. The manual
          setting might be used if one lead edge flap gets stuck and you need to have both leading-edge flaps
          at the same setting.
     •    The FLCS Reset switch allows a reset of the FLCS warning and related lights, and it resets servo and
          electrical FLCS system failures.
     •    The FLCS BIT switch commands a BIT test of the FLCS if there is weight on wheels. Running the BIT
          test will run the flight control surface test sequence and something you’d do during start up. The
          switch is magnetically held to the BIT position while the BIT is run, which lasts about 45 seconds.
          While running, the green BIT light illuminates. Once complete and successful, the light turns off and
          the switch snaps back to center. A red fail light appears if a problem is encountered in the BIT, and
          the failure would be listed on the pilot fault list display, or PFLD.


Manual Trim Panel
Under normal flight conditions, you’ll never have to use this panel as the F-16 does a great job in auto-trimming
in pitch, but you can trim for pitch and roll using the trim switch on the control stick.
     •    In the top left corner of the panel is the roll trim wheel and indicator.
     •    In the bottom right corner is the pitch trim wheel and indicator.
     •    In the bottom left corner is the yaw trim dial without indicator.
     •    The trim autopilot disconnect switch allows you to disable control stick trim and autopilot mode in
          case the trim hat on the stick malfunctions.


Fuel Control Panel
The fuel control panel includes controls for fuel system management.
     •    On the leftmost side is the Master Fuel switch, which is guarded. It opens or closes the main fuel
          shutoff valve. This is normally guarded to the on position.
     •    Next to it is the Tank Inerting switch that can pump non-volatile halon gas into the fuel tanks to reduce
          internal pressure and reduce risk for fire during an emergency (e.g., from battle damage).
     •    To the right of that is the Engine Feed knob that energizes or de-energizes the fuel pumps and
          maintains center of gravity with fuel loading.
     •    The engine feed dial provides you automatic or manual aircraft fuel balancing. An imbalance is
          indicated on the fuel gauge by a divergence between the two fuel needles. The Aft and Forward
          settings allow selective pump control for those fuel tanks with cross-feed. These also allow manual
          shifting of center of gravity. The norm position allows the fuel system to try to auto-balance, and off
          turns off the fuel pumps.
     •    On the right side of the panel is the Air Refuel switch that opens or closes the aerial refueling door on
          the spine of the aircraft, behind the canopy and sets the flight control gains to take-off-and land.


IFF Control Panel
The IFF control panel provides backup control of essential CNI functions and some primary functions of IFF.


EXT Lighting Control Panel
The External Lighting Control Panel controls all externally mounted lights on the aircraft.
     •    The anti-collision knob has an OFF and seven options that apply to the anti-collision lights when in
          flashing mode: 1 to 4 and A to C. These vary in their flash pattern.
     •    The Flash and Steady switch toggles the position lights between flashing and steady modes.
     •    Both the Wing/Tail and Fuselage switches have three positions that can be set to bright, OFF, or
          dimmed.
     •    In the bottom left corner of the panel is the Formation Lights Knob that controls brightness of the
          formation lights.
     •    To the right of this is the Master Covert knob that has positions for external lights overt and convert
          modes for night vision.
     •    Finally, there is the Aerial Refueling door light that sets the brightness of the light that shines on the
          refueling receptacle so that the air refueling boom operator can identify the receptacle during night
          refueling operations.


EPU Control Panel
The EPU is a hydrazine-powered, self-contained unit that can provide emergency hydraulic and electrical power
for about 10 to 15 minutes. You would most often use this if you lose your engine, and the EPU would provide
power to the hydraulic and electrical systems.
     •    At the bottom of the panel is the guarded EPU switch. In the NORM position it will operate
          automatically when conditions demand, like loss of both hydraulic systems and/or loss of both
          MAIN/STBY generators, but it can also be manually used when set to the ON position. When the
          EPU is running and within proper turbine range, the EPU Run light illuminates.
     •    The AIR light illuminates when the EPU is engaged and running on Air and not Hydrazine and the
          HYDRAZINE light is lit when hydrazine is used to power to the turbine.


ELEC Control Panel
The Electrical Panel selects the electrical power source for the aircraft.
     •    From the power switch you can select Main Power that connects external power or the main
          generator to the electrical system; Battery connects the battery to the battery bus; and Off disables
          electrical power. When starting the aircraft, you would first place the switch in battery power to run
          tests, and after that place that switch to main power for engine start.
     •    Below the switch is the Electrical Caution Reset button that can clear electrical system caution lights
          and resets the main and standby generators.
     •    On the right side of the panel are a series of lights that include an amber Main Generator light when
          there is no external or main generator power; an amber Standby Generator light that indicates that
          standby generator power is not available; an amber EPU Generator light that the EPU is running but
          not providing power to both emergency buses; and an amber EPU Permanent Magnet Generator that
          indicates the EPU has been turned on, but there is not enough power from the PMG to power all
          branches of the FLCS.
     •    Along the bottom of the panel are the Aircraft Battery Indicator Lights. The Fail light comes on if there
          is less than 20 volts in the battery when airborne or a battery failure on the ground; if the TO FLCS
          light illuminates it means that one or more FLCS branches is getting less than 25 volts while airborne
          or battery power is going to one or more FLCS branches while on the ground; and the FLCS RLY will
          illuminate if one or more FLCS branches is getting less than 20 volts or one or more are not
          connected to the battery.


ECM Control Panel
This panel includes controls and indicators related to ECM equipment if installed.


AVTR Control Panel
The Airborne Video Tape Recorder, or AVTR, records HUD and MFDs or helmet and MFDs depending on the
setting.


ENG & JET Start Control Panel
As the name implies, the Engine and Jet Start Control Panel governs starter for the GE-129 engine and related
controls.
     •    At the top of the panel is the Jet Fuel starter switch with OFF and START1 and START2 positions.
          These use one or two brake/jet fuel starter accumulators to drive the hydraulic starter motor. Using
          JP8 fuel, start 2 should be used.
     •    Next to the switch is the JFS run light that illuminates within 30 seconds after JFS initiation.
     •    Below is the guarded switch for Primary and Secondary engine control modes. You normally have
          this in primary mode unless you run into a failure of the engine’s digital electronic control, in which
          case you can select secondary mode, or you will have to cycle it to restart the engine after a
          flameout. Note that in secondary mode you have no afterburner. Also, in secondary mode, the sec
          light will illuminate on the caution panel and you will have a higher thrust at idle power.
     •    The max power switch at the bottom of the panel is inoperative and not used for the GE-129 engine.
UHF Backup Control Panel
While most of your radio use will be through the integrated control panel, or ICP, and data entry display, or
DED, on the instrument panel, a backup UHF radio control panel is also available. It must be used before
engine start as it’s the sole radio that functions on battery power. This includes a door with the preset channel
entry button behind it with the selected preset channel to the right of the door. To the right of that is the knob to
select a preset channel.
For those familiar with our A-10C, this is the same UHF radio.
In the center of the panel are the controls to set a frequency with input dials display windows.
Along the bottom is the function knob to control radio power and mode, a tone signal button, the volume knob,
squelch select, and mode select knob for manual, preset or guard frequency (243.0).


Audio 1 Control Panel
The audio 1 panel controls the power and volume of both radios, comm 1 and comm 2, and both radios have
settings to disable the squelch, enable squelch, and guard setting. On the right side of the panel are controls to
set secure voice volume, Sidewinder missile seeker volume, audio threat warning volume, and a TF tone knob
that is not functional in the real jet.


Audio 2 Control Panel
Just below the audio 1 control panel is the control panel for audio 2, and this includes an intercom volume knob
that controls communication volume for the ground crew and boom operator, a TACAN code volume,
instrument landing system, or ILS, power and localizer identification signal volume, and a hot mic switch.


Manual Pitch Override Switch
In case of a deep stall departure, the pitch override switch allows you to command greater authority from the
stabs to help get the nose pointed downhill so you can pick up speed for controlled flight. The guards on either
side of the switch allow the pilot to better grip the switch in case of an inverted departure when hanging upside
down from the seat straps.


Canopy Jettison Handle
In case of emergency, you can pull the canopy jettison handle. This would be used if the primary ejection
handle is pulled but the canopy fails to separate, preventing ejection.


De-Fog Lever
The de-fog lever can be moved forward and back to provide de-fogging to the canopy.

Sensor Power Control Panel
The sensor control panel consists of four switches. They are all power switches to turn off and on power to the
chin pod stations, the fire control radar, or FCR, and the radar altimeter.


HUD Remote Control Panel
As the name implies, the HUD control panel determines what and how information is displayed to the HUD.
Operation is covered in detail in the HUD section below.


Interior Lighting Control Panel
The interior lighting panel consists of three knobs that turn on and control the brightness of the cockpit
instruments. Most of the lighting is green to support night vision systems. The primary consoles knob controls
the lighting of the left and right consoles. The primary instrument panel knob sets the lighting for the instrument
panel and auxiliary panels. The primary data entry display knob controls the lighting of the DED and PFLD
displays.
The dim bright switch sets the AoA indexer, nose wheel steering / aerial refueling lights, the DED, ECM control
panel, MFDs, PFLD, and threat warning indicators to either bright or dim.
The flood instrument knob controls the flood light intensity on the instrument panel and the flood consoles knob
controls flood light intensity on the left and right consoles.
Air Cond Control Panel
The Environmental Control System Panel is split between setting the cockpit temperature and setting the bleed
air source. The temp control has no real function in a simulation, but the air source knob has options of off that
closes all engine bleed air valves. NORM sets the ECS for automatic operation; DUMP dumps cockpit pressure
and uses conditioned bleed air to ventilate the cockpit and avionics; and RAM dumps cockpit pressure, closes
the bleed air valves, and uses ram air to ventilate the cockpit and avionics.


Secure Voice Panel
The secure voice system is used in conjunction with the UHF and VHF radios to provide secure voice
communications.


Voice Message Switch
The Voice Message Inhibit switch allows you to silence all aircraft voice messages when set to inhibit.


Oxygen Panel
The oxygen regulation panel controls the flow of O2 to the facemask. The supply lever enables the system to be
off, supply air in the on setting, or also include pressure breathing for G with the PBG setting. The dilute lever
can be set to normal O2 mixture or 100% 02, and the emergency lever can set the system between emergency,
normal, and mask test. At the top of the panel is a gauge that indicates the PSI of the O2 system.


Engine Anti Ice Switch
The anti-ice system prevents ice buildup on probes and the engine. It is activated by placing the switch in the
ON position or it can be set to AUTO and will automatically turn one if ice is detected. Off disables the system.


ANT SEL Panel
The two switches of the antenna select panel allow you to select the upper, both, or just lower antennas for IFF
and the UHF radios.


Avionics Power Panel
The avionics power control panel has the following functions:
     •    Power to the modular mission computer (MMC)
     •    Power to the store stations (ST STA)
     •    Power to the two MFDs
     •    Power to the upfront controls (UFC)
     •    There is also a map power switch (not functional in the Block 50 Viper)
     •    Power to the GPS receiver
     •    And power to the data link (DL)
     •    The inertial navigation system (INS) knob has selections for off, stored, and normal ground alignment,
          normal INS navigation, in-flight alignment (IFA), and attitude (ATT) mode. The ATT mode provides
          pitch, roll, and heading information only. The IFA mode allows you correct INS alignment by flying a
          stable attitude while the INS realigns.
     •    The multifunctional information distribution system (MIDS) knob that can turn off the MIDS radio or
          zeroize all data.


Zeroize Switch
In an emergency, the zeroize switch can erase all sensitive data from all systems like secure voice, GPS keys,
and others.
HANDS-ON CONTROLS (HOTAS)
The Hands-On Controls, sometimes referred to as Hands on Throttle and Stick (HOTAS), allows control of key
systems while never taking your hands off the flight controls. Switches on the throttle and stick allow hands-on
interface with the fire control system and perform various weapons delivery functions. Some of these switches
are multipurpose and their function at any one time depends upon master mode, weapons delivery mode, and
the sensor of interest (SOI).


Stick
The primary function of the control stick is to provide pitch and roll commands to maneuver the aircraft. Pushing
and pulling on the stick affects aircraft pitch (moves the horizontal tails) and moving the stick from side to side
inputs roll (moves the flaperons and horizontal tails).
The stick has several buttons and hats that allow you to manipulate the various systems without having to take
your hands off the stick.

Throttle
The engine is controlled by a throttle mounted above the left console with detents at OFF, IDLE, MIL, and MAX
AB. The OFF position terminates engine ignition and fuel flow. The IDLE position commands minimum thrust
and is used for all ground starts and air starts. From IDLE to MIL, the throttle controls the output of the engine.
Forward of the MIL position, the throttle controls the operation of the afterburner.
The throttle also contains switches that provide various systems control. As with the control stick, the HOTAS
functions of the throttles vary in functionality depending on the state and operational modes of the aircraft.
Those are discussed in the appropriate sections of this document.

Sensor of Interest (SOI)
The SOI is the sensor or display for which the hands-on controls are currently active. Similar functions are
activated by the same switches, whenever possible, to provide consistent operation regardless of the SOI or
mode selected. Further operation of these switches is detailed in the appropriate mode discussions later in this
guide.
The current SOI can be identified by the box around the MFD screen or the asterisk in the top left of the HUD.




                         SOI Box

                                                                            SOI Asterisk




The SOI is changed from display to display with the Display Management Switch (DMS). Basic functionality as it
applies to SOI is:
                                                                                    Display Management
                                                                                    Switch




     •     DMS FWD. SOI transitions to the HUD if in A-G Master Mode
     •     DMS AFT. SOI transitions from the HUD to the highest priority MFD. DMS Aft again swaps SOI to the
           other MFD.


Sensor Point of Interest (SPI)
The sensor point of interest (SPI) is the location that all sensors onboard the aircraft are normally slaved to.
Without any input from the pilot, the SPI follows the current steerpoint, and so all sensors that are slaved to the
SPI will initially be looking at the current steerpoint.
The SPI can be moved off the steerpoint location by slewing the cursor of a sensor, such as the air-to-ground
radar or targeting pod. When the sensor cursor is slewed, the SPI follows it, and all steerpoints offset by the
slew amount. To wit, if your steerpoint #2 were directly over a road intersection, and your steerpoint #3 were
200 feet south of a tank column, and you slewed your SPI 200 feet north to put it directly on the tank column,
your steerpoint #2 would now be 200 feet north of the road intersection. In fact, all your steerpoints will be
shifted 200 feet north.




 Steerpoint #2 is directly over a   Steerpoint #3 is 200 feet to   Steerpoint #3 is slewed onto   Steerpoint #2 is now shifted to
       road intersection             the left of a tank column           the tank column               the right of the road
                                                                                                           intersection

This behavior might seem puzzling at first, but remember that prior to the availability of GPS, coordinates were
not precise and navigation systems would drift over time. It is assumed that if the target steerpoint is not directly
over the target, then by slewing the sensor to the target, any accumulated drift in the navigational system has
been removed.
The change in SPI position caused by slewing the sensors is called “system delta.” To remove system delta,
you can press the OSB labeled Cursor Zero (CZ), PB9 in the above picture. This will remove any delta from the
system; steerpoint 2 will be back at the road intersection, and steerpoint 3 will no longer be over the tank
column. The CZ OSB is available on most MFD sensor formats.
In addition to the system delta, some sensors (such as the AGM-65 WPN page) can have their own deltas,
independent of system delta. When you slew the targeting pod cursor, it changes the system delta; however,
when you slew the AGM-65 cursor, it changes only its own delta, and the system delta (and SPI) are not
moved.




                   Both the TGP and AGM-65 start with no delta, positioned directly over the current steerpoint.




             First the TGP is slewed, creating system delta, and moving the SPI. The AGM-65 seeker follows the SPI.




    Then SOI is moved to the WPN page and the AGM-65 is slewed. No new system delta is added, and the TGP does not move.
Pressing the Cursor Zero (CZ) button on the TGP page will erase system delta, moving the SPI (and the targeting pod) to the original
                           steerpoint location. The AGM-65 maintains its own delta and does not move.
UP-FRONT CONTROLS (UFC)
The upfront controls (UFC) include the Integrated Control Panel (ICP) and the Data Entry Display (DED). These
provide for quick access of either navigation control, radio frequencies and channels and fire control system
modes and data. Most of your time will be spent using the ICP to control these functions but less frequently
used functions, such as power and audio volume, are located on console panels.
Data accessed through the ICP is displayed on the DED.




      Integrated Control Panel (ICP)




                                                                                Data Entry Display (DED)




The upfront controls are available during normal operations when the C&I knob (IFF Control Panel) is set to the
UFC position. This provides for control of communications, navigation, and IFF primarily via upfront controls. In
the event of failure of the upfront controls, the BACKUP position provides for alternate operation of the radios
and IFF, using their cockpit panels.
Integrated Control Panel (ICP)
The ICP provides master mode selection, control of communication, navigation, and identification (CNI)
equipment, data entry of weapons delivery related information, and HUD power/intensity control.

System Time. This is the time used by aircraft systems for navigation. System time is automatically entered
into the avionics system based on GPS data. No manual entering of system time is required. However, to enter
a new system time, position the DCS switch up or down until the asterisks are next to the system time field.
Enter the time using the ICP keypad and press the ENTR pushbutton.
Hack Time. This allows for an additional time reference independent of system time. Examples of its use
include setting a backup time reference for local, or some other pre-arranged time or using it as a stopwatch for
low level navigation.
To enter a new time, position the DCS switch up or down until the asterisks are next to the hack time field. Enter
the time using the ICP keypad and press the ENTR pushbutton. The new hack time will be displayed here and
on the CNI page.
Pressing the INC/DEC switch up to INC starts the timer. Pressing it again stops the timer.
Pressing the INC/DEC switch down to DEC resets the timer to zero.
Delta Time over Steerpoint (TOS). This allows you to update the Time over Steerpoint for all steerpoints from
one place. This could be useful if, for example, the planned time on target for all aircraft in a strike package
changes. TOS may be updated by entering a delta TOS value on the DED. The entered time will be added to or
subtracted from all TOS values. Enterable values range from -23:59:59 to 23:59:59.
Date. A new date may be entered here using the MM/DD/YY format.
BNGO Page
This page allows entry of a bingo fuel value. Voice Message and HUD warnings will be based on the amount of
fuel in pounds entered here. It is accessed by selecting option (2) from the LIST menu.

                                                             Fuel Remaining




Bingo Setting. The desired bingo fuel setting may be entered here. When total fuel remaining decreases below
this value, “Bingo-Bingo” will be heard through the pilot’s headset, the letters FUEL will be displayed in the
lower left of the HUD and the letters FUEL will flash in the center of the HUD. The flashing warning may be
reset by positioning the DRIFT C/O switch on the ICP to the WARN RESET position. All three warnings may be
reset by entering a bingo level lower than current fuel remaining.
Fuel Remaining. Total fuel remaining in pounds.

All information is displayed on a combining glass mounted in the forward field of view at eye level. The
symbology is focused at infinity and superimposed upon the outside world along the flightpath of the aircraft.
The HUD remote control panel (right console) provides control of the HUD set.
Together, the remote and integrated control panels control the symbology displayed. HUD data is displayed as
a function of the selected master mode and sub-mode. The display surface field of view is 25° in diameter and
extends down to a line 10.5° below the FOV center.


HUD Remote Control Panel
As the name implies, the HUD control panel determines what and how information is displayed to the HUD. The
panel consists of eight switches.
Scales Switch. When set to VV/VAH, the vertical velocity scale, velocity scale, altitude scale, and heading tape
are displayed. When set to VAH, all the scales are displayed except the vertical velocity scale. Off removes all
scales but digital readouts.
Flightpath Marker Switch. When set to ATT/FPM displays both the flight path marker and attitude reference
bars. When set to FPM, just the flight path marker is displayed. Off removes both.
DED Data/PFL Switch. This switch allows data from these displays to visible on the HUD, based on DED or
PFLD selection. Off displays neither.
Depressible Reticle Switch. The depressed reticle switch controls selection of the primary and secondary
standby reticles on the HUD. Standby displays the standby reticle and removes all other HUD symbology.
Primary displays the primary reticle but does not remove any HUD symbology. Off does not display either
reticle.
Velocity Switch. The airspeed switch allows airspeed to be displayed as calibrated airspeed, true airspeed, or
ground speed.
Altitude Switch. This switch allows the altitude tape to indicate radar altitude, barometric altitude, or off. When
set to off, radar altitude is displayed when above ground altitude is below 1,500 feet and barometric altitude
when above.
Brightness Control Switch. The HUD brightness switch has default brightness settings for day and night and
an auto brightness function that will adjust accordingly.
Test Switch. Displays a test pattern in ON. The TEST STEP position steps through the four different test
patterns.
NAVIGATION
INS NAVIGATION
The inertial navigation system (INS) is the primary navigation system of the F-16C and provides accurate
attitude, navigation, and vertical and horizontal steering information. The Up-Front Controls (UFC) are the
primary interface device to the INS. In this Navigation chapter we will discuss the practical application of using
the INS for navigation purposes.


INS Alignment
The navigation system can be aligned by a variety of methods on the ground or in the air. This is started by
positioning the INS knob on the Avionics Power panel to the desired position. The INS knob is set to NAV when
the alignment is complete.




The Normal (NORM) Alignment is the primary alignment mode. The NORM alignment requires approximately
eight minutes to fully accomplish.
The Stored Heading (STOR HDG) Alignment allows for a quick alignment in 90 seconds or less in some
conditions. This can only be used if the aircraft has been set up specifically for this alignment beforehand.
An Inflight Alignment (INFLT ALIGN) places the INS in ATT mode and performs an in-flight alignment. The
pilot must hold the aircraft steady and level during this process.
In Attitude (ATT) mode, only attitude and heading information is given to the avionics.


Normal Gyrocompass (NORM) Alignment
A full INS alignment in the NORM position should be accomplished prior to every flight. This is normally started
just after engine start and avionics power-up to allow time for the full alignment to complete prior to taxi.
1.   Position the INS knob to the NORM position.
     This begins the INS alignment and calls up the INS page on the DED. The progress of the alignment may
     be monitored from here.
          Time into Alignment                                                        Alignment Status

                 True Heading



     Time into Alignment. This is the elapsed time in minutes and decimal seconds since the INS alignment
     began.
     Alignment Status. This is an estimate of the alignment quality. Values count down from 99 with the
     following meanings:
     •    99 – Initialization
     •    90 – Valid attitude data, coarse align begins
     •    79 – Valid heading data
     •    70 – Degraded navigation state, steady RDY displayed on DED, steady ALIGN displayed on HUD
     •    60-20 – Circular error probability (CEP) multiplier compared to fully aligned state; 60 = 6.0 times
          normal CEP, 20 = 2.0 times normal CEP
     •    10 – INS fully aligned, RDY flashes on DED, ALIGN flashes on HUD
     •    6 – INS fully aligned and enhanced to 0.6 times normal precision with GPS data or other techniques
     Latitude. Latitude of start position.
     Longitude. Longitude of start position
     System Altitude. Altitude used by the fire control computer for air to ground weapons delivery
     True Heading. Last known true heading or heading derived during alignment
     Ground Speed. Current ground speed.
2.   Enter the latitude, longitude, and altitude for the starting location.
     The last known coordinates and estimate of altitude are displayed when the alignment begins, however the
     data must be re-entered even if it is still correct.
     If the data is accurate, use the DCS switch to highlight each line and press ENTR for each in turn. If the
     data is not accurate, enter the correct data for each field with the ICP keypad.
     Failure to enter the data will flag the alignment as degraded and not allow important monitoring functions to
     take place. Navigation, weapons delivery and targeting pod pointing errors may also result.
     The alignment will stop and start again if the data is entered later than two minutes into the alignment.
3.   Monitor alignment progress and switch INS knob to NAV.
     The RDY on the DED and ALIGN on the HUD will begin to flash when the alignment is complete. This
     should happen in 8 minutes or less. Position the INS knob to NAV to accept the alignment.



                                                                                       Alignment Status




Stored Heading (STOR HDG) Alignment
A Stored Heading alignment option is available to allow a faster INS alignment in certain situations. This can be
useful for “scramble” missions or for situations when your playtime is limited.
This alignment assumes a full gyrocompass alignment was already performed before the aircraft was last shut
down and the aircraft has not been moved. The previously computed true heading is stored in the Inertial
Navigation Unit (INU), a component of the INS, and is used to give the alignment process a head start. The new
alignment should take about 90 seconds.
1.   Position the INS knob to the STOR HDG position.
     This begins the INS alignment and calls up the INS page on the DED. The progress of the alignment may
     be monitored from here just as on a normal alignment.
          Time into Alignment                                                         Alignment Status

                 True Heading



2.   Verify, but do not enter, the latitude, longitude, altitude, and true heading for the starting location.
3.   Monitor alignment progress and switch INS knob to NAV.
     The RDY on the DED and ALIGN on the HUD will begin to flash when the alignment is complete. This
     should happen in about 90 seconds. Position the INS knob to NAV to accept the alignment.
                                                                                        Alignment Status




Inflight (INFLT) Alignment
It is possible to lose your INS alignment inflight due to electrical failure, battle damage or switchology errors. A
new alignment may be obtained while airborne provided the INS is functional and GPS data is available. If GPS
is not available, the inflight alignment will not complete.
1.   Position the INS knob to OFF for 10 seconds.
2.   Maintain straight, level and unaccelerated flight.
3.   Position the INS knob to the INFLT position.
     This begins the inflight INS alignment and calls up the INFLT ALIGN page on the DED. No action or data
     entry is required on this page if GPS data is available. An initial heading may be entered based on
     magnetic compass reading or other outside sources, but this is not required.




                                                                                        Initial Heading




     The STBY mnemonic will replace the max G indication in the HUD, showing that coarse alignment of the
     inertial platform is in progress. Horizon line, pitch ladders and compass information may be displayed but
     will not be accurate.
            Alignment Status




4.   Maintain straight, level and unaccelerated flight for approximately one minute, until ALIGN appears
     in the HUD.




                Alignment Status




     This indicates that coarse alignment is complete and fine alignment is in progress. Attitude information
     becomes available in the HUD and ADI, and the aircraft may be maneuvered normally.
     Shortly after attitude information appears, the flight path marker, steering cue, aircraft heading, and HSI
     navigation data become available. Reliability of the data increases as the alignment progresses.\
5.   Switch INS knob to NAV after Max-G replaces ALIGN in the HUD.
     Replacement of ALIGN with Max-G shows that the alignment is complete. The mission may proceed
     normally from there.
                       Max-G




HUD Indication
You can view your current heading on the top or bottom of the HUD, depending on the selected master mode.
The heading scale shows your current magnetic heading indicated by the central caret.
The Steering Cue shows the heading to your selected steerpoint. If you turn the aircraft to align the Flight Path
Marker with the Steering Cue, you will be flying to your steerpoint.

Horizontal Situation Display (HSD) Indication
When there is an active steerpoint, it will be displayed on the HSD as a solid circle. Other steerpoints will be
displayed as empty circles with lines connecting them all to show the route. The ownship marker shows your
aircraft’s current position.

Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) Indication
The HSI is your primary gauge to assist in navigation to steerpoints, TACAN beacons, and radio beacons.
While you will likely be using HUD symbology for most of your navigation purposes, a firm understanding of the
HSI is necessary for access to additional navigation data that is not present on the HUD or DED displays, and
in case of battle damage.

Compass Card. Arrayed around the periphery of the HSI, this is a compass that rotates such that the top of the
compass indicates the aircraft’s magnetic heading.
Aircraft Symbol. In the center of the gauge is the aircraft symbol that always remains static. All HSI displays
reference this symbol.
Lubber Line. This is a fixed line that runs from the aircraft symbol to the top of the gauge. This line represents
current aircraft heading in relation to the compass card.
Range Indicator. Indicating range in nautical miles, this three-place drum indicator provides slant distance from
your aircraft to the selected steerpoint or TACAN station.
Bearing Pointer. This arrow-shaped indicator moves around the outside of the compass card and points to the
current steerpoint or TACAN station. Located 180° from the Bearing Pointer head is the tail that represents the
reciprocal bearing.
Heading Set Knob. Located in the lower left portion of the gauge, when rotated, this knob allows you to set the
position of the Heading Marker on the compass card.
Heading Bug. Shown as two thick lines on the outside of the compass card, this marker can be moved around
the compass card using the Heading Set Knob. After being set, this marker rotates with the Compass Card to
provide a heading to the selected magnetic bearing.
Course Set Knob. Positioned in the lower right corner of the gauge, this knob, when rotated, allows you to set
the course numeric in the Course Selector Window and move the course pointer around the compass card.
Course Indicator. This window displays the course set using the Course Set Knob numerically in degrees.
Course Pointer. Set by the Course Set Knob, these two lines represent the set course and reciprocal course
on the compass card.
Course Deviation Indicator. This line that runs through the center area of the gauge provides an indication of
how accurately you are flying on the set course line. When the line runs through the aircraft symbol in the center
of the gauge, you are on course. If it is to either side, you need to correct your heading to place the aircraft back
on the course line.
To-From Indicator. These two triangles along the intended course line indicate the course the aircraft will fly to
or away from the selected TACAN station or steerpoint.
TACAN NAVIGATION
The Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) system is a world-wide array of omni-directional beacons with unique
frequency codes used primarily by military aircraft. Civilian aircraft use a similar system called VOR’s (VHF
omni-direction Beacon) on a different frequency range. Many VOR stations are collocated with a TACAN. These
stations broadcast both signals so they can be used by military and/or civilian aircraft. These stations are known
as “VORTACS”.
TACAN beacons can not only be set on the ground, but they can also be attached to aircraft and even ships
(aircraft carriers). TACAN serves as a useful means to quickly navigate to a defined location.
The TACAN is part of the MIDS terminal and must be activated by rotating the MIDS LVT knob on the Avionics
Power Panel to the ON position. TACAN audio tone volume is controlled on the AUDIO 2 panel.




The currently selected TACAN station is always displayed on the bottom right of the DED CNI page. You can
see station 1X is selected in this example.




Before navigating using TACAN though, you will want to do the following:
Select TACAN Station
1.   To select a new station, press the T-ILS priority function button on the ICP. That displays the TACAN/ILS
     page on the DED. Information on the TACAN system is displayed on the left half of the page.




2.   On the ICP, toggle the DCS switch down to highlight the CHAN field. Use the ICP keypad to type in the
     new channel. Press ENTR to accept the changes.
     In this example, channel 25 is entered. The system has identified it as beacon GTB, a TACAN station at
     Tbilisi.




3.   If required, you may change the band by typing 0 (M-SEL) into the CHAN field or scratchpad and pressing
     ENTR. This toggles the band between X and Y.
4.   On the ICP, toggle the DCS right to cycle through the following options: REC, T/R, A/A REC, or A/A TR.
     REC. The TACAN operates in receive mode only and provides bearing, course deviation, and station
     identification.
     T/R. The TACAN acts in a transceiver mode (send and receive) and provides bearing, range, deviation,
     and station identification. This will be your most common selection.
     A/A REC. TACAN operates in Air-to-Air mode and can only receive bearing, course deviation and station
     identification for a TACAN-equipped aircraft.
     A/A T/R. TACAN operates in Air-to-Air transceiver mode and provides bearing, range, deviation, and
     station identification with a TACAN-equipped aircraft.
     In most cases, you will keep the TACAN set to the T/R mode.




5.   Toggle the DCS left to RTN. This will return you to the CNI page where your new TACAN channel is
     displayed at the bottom right.
Navigate to Selected TACAN Station
Once a valid TACAN station has been entered on the DED, the station is within operative range, steering
information is available on the HSI.
Press the Mode selector until TCN is displayed in the Current Mode field. Operation is identical to steerpoint
navigation except the bearing pointer points to the TACAN station instead of the steerpoint.

                                                                                      Lubber Line

               Heading Marker
                                                                                      Course Set Knob
            Heading Set Knob

                                                                                     Current Mode


                                                                                     Mode Selector



Note: TACANs are considered reliable for only 130 nm, so the maximum distance between TACAN stations is
generally 260 nm.
INSTRUMENT LANDING SYSTEM NAVIGATION
The landing approach using the Instrumented Landing System (ILS) is generally used under Instrument Flight
Rules (IFR) conditions due to night or bad weather. When used, the ILS provides vertical and horizontal
steering information to help you fly down the correct glide slope and heading to a safe landing. The ILS
frequency is set using the Up-Front Controls (UFC) and ILS steering is selected on the HSI. Steering
information is then presented on the HUD, ADI and HSI instruments. The ILS provides steering for a straight in
approach.
In addition to the instrument indications, the ILS has a localizer audio signal. The ILS provides an audio cue
when flying over either the outer or inner marker beacons. You can control the audio levels on the Audio 2
control panel.
Most, but not all runways, allow landings from either direction but will depend on the wind direction. The ILS
system should be used for the appropriate landing runway as directed by ATC.
The ILS system must be activated by rotating the ILS knob on the Audio 2 Control Panel out of the OFF
position.




The ILS operates between 108.1 and 111.95 MHz. The frequency for any runway equipped for ILS may be
seen on the Mission Planner map before mission start or in-game using the F10 map view. Click any airfield
and the information will be displayed.
In the next example, we will set the system up for a landing at Vaziani runway 31, using frequency 108.75.


Select ILS Frequency
1.   To select a new station, press the T-ILS priority function button on the ICP. That displays the TACAN/ILS
     page on the DED. Information on the ILS system is displayed on the right half of the page.
2.   On the ICP, toggle the DCS switch down to highlight the FREQ field. Use the ICP keypad to type in the
     new frequency.
     Press ENTR to accept the changes.
3.   Then, toggle the DCS switch down to highlight the CRS field. Use the ICP keypad to type in the localizer
     course.
     Press ENTR to accept the changes.




In this example, we set the system up for a landing at Vaziani runway 31, using frequency 108.75. CMD STRG
is highlighted indicating the ILS signal is being received.


Navigate with ILS Glide Slope and Localizer
Once a valid ILS station has been entered, the station is within operative range, and ILS is selected as the
activate navigation mode, you will be provided steering information on the ADI and HSI to the selected station
(much like TACAN).
Selecting one of the PLS (Precision Landing System) modes on the HSI is required before ILS deviation data
(localizer and glide slope) can be displayed on the HSI, HUD, and ADI.
      HSI Indications
      Press the Mode Select button on the HSI until either PLS NAV or PLS TCN mode is displayed.



                                                                                  Manually Selected Course

PLS Mode Indicator




      Mode Selector




      Operation is identical to steerpoint navigation except the bearing pointer points to the ILS localizer instead of
      the steerpoint.


      ADI Indications
      The ADI provides indications that show your position in relation to the glideslope.




       Glideslope                                                                 Localizer and Glideslope Deviation
       Deviation Scale




         Glideslope
         Indicator
Localizer and Glide Slope Deviation. When the horizontal bar is centered on the ADI, you are flying on glide
slope. If the bar is above the center of the ADI, it indicates that you are below glide slope and you need to
increase altitude. The vertical localizer bar indicates if you are left or right of runway alignment. If the bar is right
of ADI center, fly to the right to center it, then resume localizer course. For a proper glide slope approach, you
want the two bars centered and forming a perfect cross on the ADI (aka “center the bars”).
Glide Slope Deviation Scale and Glide Slope Indicator. Located along the left side of the ADI, this fixed
scale and moving caret indicator displays the position of the glide slope in relation to the aircraft. Basically, the
caret is the glide slope. If it is high, you are low. For example: if the caret is on the bottom dot, you are above
the glide slope. The common terminology would be “you are 2 dots high”. Conversely, if the caret is on the first
dot above middle you are below the glide slope. The term would be “you are 1 dot low”. It is a general rule that if
you go more than 1 dot low or more than 2 dots high you go missed approach and try again.
Glide Slope and Localizer Warning Flags (not visible). When displayed, this indicates that there is a problem
in receiving adequate ILS glide slope or localizer signal.


HUD Indications
The HUD also shows your position in relation to the glideslope. Command Steering guidance is also provided if
CMD STRG is highlighted on the ILS DED page.




         Localizer and
         Glideslope Deviation                                                               Command Steering



         Flightpath Marker




Command Steering Symbol. This symbol will be displayed on the HUD to guide you through the approach
when valid localizer data is received. A tic mark appears on the symbol when nearing the center of the
glideslope to indicate the pitch steering data is valid.
Localizer and Glide Slope Bars. These bars serve the same function as those on the ADI. When the
horizontal bar is centered on the Flight Path Marker (FPM), you are flying down the glide slope projected by
the ILS vertical steering component. If the bar is above the center of the FPM, it indicates that you are below
glide slope and you need to increase altitude. The vertical localizer bar indicates if you are left or right of runway
alignment. If the bar is right of FPM center, fly to the right to center it. For a proper glide slope approach, you
want the two bars centered and forming a perfect cross on the FPM (aka “center the bars”).
AUTOPILOT
The two autopilot switches allow you to set and hold pitch and roll. Any combination of switch settings may be
used.




PITCH – ALT HOLD. This maintains the aircraft at a constant altitude. The autopilot will attempt to maintain the
current altitude from when the switch is set but may not be able to capture the desired altitude if the aircraft is in
a climb or dive. An altitude within the control authority of the autopilot will be commanded. The altitude may be
changed by pressing the paddle switch, flying to a new altitude, and releasing the paddle switch.
PITCH – ATT HOLD. This maintains the aircraft’s current pitch attitude, nose up or nose down. The autopilot
will not engage if the pitch angle exceeds ±60°, however, the switch may remain engaged. The stick may be
used to change the attitude in this mode.
ROLL – HDG SEL. This causes the aircraft to fly the heading selected on the HSI. Roll commands are limited
to a 30° bank or a 20° per second roll rate to capture the desired heading. The autopilot will not engage if the
roll angle exceeds ±60°, however, the switch may remain engaged.
ROLL – ATT HOLD. This maintains the aircraft’s current roll attitude. The autopilot will not engage if the roll
angle exceeds ±60°, however, the switch may remain engaged. The stick may be used to change the attitude in
this mode.
The switches are held in place until they are returned to the OFF position or any of these situations occur:
     •    air refueling door opened
     •    alt flaps extended below 400 knots
     •    A/P FAIL PFL
     •    AoA exceeds 15°
     •    DBU on
     •    landing gear extended
     •    low-speed warning
     •    MPO switch in OVERRIDE
     •    STBY GAIN PFL
     •    TRIM/AP DISC switch set to DISC
Holding the paddle switch presses disengages the autopilot until the switch is released.
RADIO COMMUNICATIONS
RADIO FREQUENCIES
The current frequency for the UHF (COM 1) and VHF (COM 2) radios are shown on the DED CNI page.




When a mission is created, each agency is provided a VHF and/or a UHF frequency. Each frequency
corresponds to a preset channel on your radios, but you may also manually enter them. These are generally
noted in the mission briefing and should be set on your radios at the start of the missions.
Generally, the following rules apply:
     •    Your flight is most often assigned a VHF frequency. You will use this frequency for intra-flight
          communications.
     •    Other friendly flights operate on a common UHF frequency assigned to the operating area. When set
          correctly, you will hear radio communications from other flights operating in the area. AWACS will
          usually be on this common frequency.
     •    The JTAC is most often assigned a unique VHF or UHF frequency.
     •    Each airbase ATC is assigned a VHF and/or a UHF frequency.
     •    Each tanker is assigned a unique VHF or UHF frequency.
As such, you may have to juggle multiple frequencies during a mission. The frequency preset features on the
radio will become a big help.


Preset Frequency Change
1.   Press the COM 1 or COM 2 override button on the ICP.
2.   Type in the desired preset channel and press ENTR
3.   The radio will now transmit and receive on the new preset frequency.
With a preset channel shown on the DED home page, you can also cycle through available presets:
1.   Toggle the DCS up or down until the arrows are displayed next to the preset channel.
2.   Use the Increment/Decrement switch to change the channel.




Manual Frequency Change
1.   Press the COM 1 or COM 2 override button on the ICP.
2.   Type in the new frequency with the ICP keypad and press ENTR
3.   The radio will now transmit and receive on the new frequency.
RADIO COMMANDS
Commands or requests to and from other agencies must be made through the radio system. On the ground, the
radio communications window may be accessed by a press of the [\] key. Once airborne, communications are
only initiated using the HOTAS controls:
UHF VHF Transmit Switch.
     •    Forward: VHF (Aux) radio [RCtrl + \]
     •    Aft: UHF (Prim) radio [RAlt + \]

There are two optional modes of using the radio that depend on the “EASY COMMUNICATION” OPTION under
the GAMEPLAY tab.


Easy Communication Not Enabled
This is the more realistic mode and requires you to know the correct modulation / frequencies for each recipient.
You must select the correct channel pre-set or manually enter the frequencies on the correct radio.


Easy Communication Enabled
The radio communications window is accessed by a press of the \ backslash key (this is for US keyboards;
other language keyboards may vary). Upon doing so, the list of radio command recipients is displayed along
with the function ([Fx]) key required to view its sub-command window.
When the radio menu is displayed, recipients are color-coded as follows:
     •    Recipients on which at least one of the radios is tuned to are colored white.
     •    Recipients on which at least one of the radios can be tuned to, but are not currently on the correct
          frequency, are colored gray.
     •    Recipients that cannot be contacted due to range or terrain masking / earth curvature are colored
          black.
Each will also have their modulation / frequency listed. When you select a recipient, the appropriate radio will
automatically be tuned to communicate with the selected recipient.
Using the transmit switch, recipients will be color-coded according to their being on the same modulation as the
selected radio.
PROCEDURES
COLD START
There are two methods you can use to start a cold and dark aircraft. The first, and easiest, is the Auto-Start. By
pressing [LWin]+[Home], the aircraft will be started automatically for you. To cease the Auto-Start, you can
press [LWin]+[End].
Being a DCS title though, the aircraft really shines when you take advantage of the detailed systems modeling,
like manually starting the aircraft.

TAXI
Whether you have completed a cold start or are starting the mission in a “hot” aircraft, your next step will be to
taxi to the runway.
When you are ready to start rolling, slowly advance the throttle [PgUp] or [Num+] and use the rudder pedals to
steer left [Z] and right [X]. Reduce throttle by pressing [PgDn] or [Num-]. Press [W] to apply wheel brakes.
Nosewheel steering gain is proportional to ground speed. As your aircraft speeds up, the rudder will become less
sensitive when controlling the nosewheel.

TAKEOFF
Once lined up for takeoff on the directed runway, you may perform a final run-up check:

 1.    Brakes                                                              Hold

       Keyboard Command: N/A
       Check for normal engine indications:
            •    HYD/OIL PRESS warning light – Off
            •    OIL pressure – 25-65 psi (must increase as RPM increases)
            •    FTIT – 935⁰ C or less
            •    HYD PRESS A & B – 2850-3250 psi


 4.    Brakes                                                        Released
       Keyboard Command: N/A
 5.    Throttle                                  Advance to desired thrust
       Keyboard Command: N/A

 6.    NWS                                            Disengage at 70 Knots
       Keyboard Command: N/A




Gently pull back on the stick and establish takeoff attitude (8–12°) at approximately 10 knots below takeoff
speed for MIL power or 15 knots below takeoff speed for AB.
 Acft Weight (lbs)       20,000       24,000       28,000        32,000       36,000       40,000       44,000

 TO Speed (KIAS)           128          142          156          168          178          188           198


Low stick forces are needed for rotation. Pulling back on the stick early may lead to uncontrollability due to early
lift-off at low speed and increase the distance needed to take off.
Ensure a positive rate of climb is established and raise the landing gear. The trailing edge flaps retract at the
same time as the landing gear and may cause the aircraft to settle and scrape the runway when lift is lost.
The landing gear should be up and locked before exceeding 300 knots. Higher airspeeds may detach wiring
and other components or cause structural damage to the landing gear doors.


Crosswind Takeoff
When taking off in a crosswind, the aircraft will want to weather-vane into the wind (turn into the wind). This will
have the result of raising the upwind wing. To counteract, you want to use a slight amount of left or right stick
into the wind direction. This will help keeping the wing level. You will also want to use a little rudder input to
keep a straight takeoff roll down the center of the runway.
During rotation, be careful to smoothly blend rudder input to establish a proper crab angle into the wind. With a
proper crab angle, the Flight Path Marker (FPM) should be aligned down the runway when becoming airborne.
NORMAL FLIGHT
There are no specific procedures to follow once airborne. You will need to rely on your own understanding of
aircraft systems and basic flight to keep the aircraft in one piece and accomplish the mission.


In-Flight Checks
At frequent intervals, check the aircraft systems, engine instruments, cockpit pressure, and oxygen flow
indicator and system operation. Monitor fuel in each internal and external tank to verify that fuel is transferring
properly by rotating the FUEL QTY SEL knob and checking that the sum of the pointers and totalizer agree, and
that fuel distribution is correct.


Trimming the Aircraft
The Flight Control System does a great job of maintaining aircraft trim but there are some situations where you
will need to manually trim the aircraft. When out of trim, you will notice the aircraft wanting to pitch, roll or yaw
(roll being the most common).
The trim switch is used to move the control stick to a new “neutral “position. For example: if the nose wants to
raise, you can input some nose down trim that will move the neutral point forward to a new position. This
relieves you from maintaining continuous pressure on the stick to maintain level flight when out of trim.


                                                                       Trim Switch




The most common need for trim is when stores are released that cause an asymmetric configuration. For
example, releasing a bomb from a left wing station but not the right will cause a roll to the right, in the direction
of the heavier wing. Roll trim will be required for the aircraft to maintain wings level flight with no stick input.
AIR REFUELING
Some missions may require air refueling to ensure you have enough fuel to reach the target and return safely to
base. Even if more fuel is not required, you may wish to top off your tanks to allow more options in the target
area, like a low altitude, high speed ingress or more liberal use of the afterburner.
Tanker locations will be noted in the mission briefing or displayed on the Mission Planner screen. Tankers are
also equipped with air-to-air TACAN to help with the rendezvous. If in doubt, you may also request a vector to
the nearest tanker from AWACS.




You should announce your intent to refuel before approaching the tanker using the communications menu.




The tanker will respond with their current altitude and airspeed and clear you to the pre-contact position.
Continue to fly the rendezvous using radar or TACAN as a guide.
The following steps should be taken to make your aircraft safe before approaching the tanker.

 1.     MASTER ARM Switch                                                      OFF
        Keyboard Command: N/A
 2.     LASER ARM Switch                                                        OFF
        Keyboard Command: N/A




 3.     Emitters                                                      OFF/STBY
        Keyboard Command: N/A
        Radiation from emitters like ECM, Radar or Radar Altimeter may present
        a hazard to tanker aircraft and personnel. Use them during the
        rendezvous if required but turn them off prior to reaching the pre-contact
        position.
        This can be done using the individual panels for each system or with the
        RF Switch. When set to SILENT, all radiation from the aircraft is disabled,
        to include the radar, radar altimeter, data link, TACAN transmit, and ECM.
        In QUIET mode though, the radar, TACAN, and data link transmit but all
        other emissions are inhibited.



Take the following steps to configure the aircraft for refueling.

 4.     AIR REFUEL Switch                                                   Open
        Keyboard Command: N/A
        This should be done 3-5 minutes prior to refueling with external fuel
        tanks to depressurize the tanks and allow them to be filled.
        Flight control gains change to takeoff and landing settings to allow fine
        control.



 5.     AR status light                                             Verify RDY

        Keyboard Command: N/A
        At night, exterior lights should be set to DIM and STEADY settings and
        the Anti-Collision light should be set to OFF.




 8.     DED Bingo Page                                                 Monitor
        Keyboard Command: N/A
        As a technique, you may choose to pull the Bingo page up on the DED
        by selecting LIST→2 on the ICP. Your total fuel load will be displayed.
        This allows you to verify you are tasking fuel without going heads-down
        to the fuel quantity indicator.




Take the pre-contact position directly behind the boom and report you are ready to refuel.
The boomer will clear you to the contact position. Use small, smooth control inputs, and add a very slight
amount of throttle. Be patient and allow that power change to move you forward.
Allow the boom to pass just left or right of your canopy, about 2-3 feet above your head. This serves as a good
first check that you are at the proper height relative to the tanker. Continue to move slowly forward, maintaining
alignment with the yellow stripe painted on the bottom of the tanker.
Fly formation on the tanker and allow the boom operator to fly the boom into the refueling receptacle behind the
cockpit on your aircraft. Use the director lights on the bottom of the tanker to maintain a position within the limits
of the boom.

                                                                                            Centerline Stripe



                 D - Down                                                                   F - Forward



                                                                                            A - Aft
                 U - Up




The lights are directive, meaning they tell you the direction to travel and not your current position. In other
words, preface the D, U, F and A with the word “go”. If the light moves toward the D, go down; if it moves
toward the U, go up. If the light moves toward the A, go aft; if it moves toward the F, go forward.
The boomer will announce ‘contact’ and ‘you are taking fuel’ when the connection is established. The AR/NWS
light next to the HUD will illuminate. Monitor your fuel transfer on the DED or Fuel Quantity indicator.
It is likely you will unintentionally disconnect at some point in the process, especially on your first few attempts.
If this happens, return to the pre-contact position, and try again.
Perform the following steps when refueling is complete.
1.   A/R DISC button on stick                                           Press
     Keyboard Command: N/A

1.       Initial Approach. Align your aircraft with the landing runway at 1,500 feet above ground level (AGL) and
         300 knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS).
2.       Overhead Break. Break left or right over the desired touchdown point, set throttle to about 80% RPM, and
         open the speedbrakes. Fly the break at about 70 deg of bank and 3-4 G. Align the HUD Flight Path Marker
         with the Horizon Line to maintain a level turn.
3.       Downwind Leg. Roll out on the downwind leg opposite the landing heading at about 200-220 KCAS and
         1,500 feet AGL. Extend the landing gear and confirm three green gear down indications. Reduce speed as
         required to prevent excessive airspeed buildup in the base turn and trim to an angle of attack (AoA) of 11°.
4.       Base Turn. Initiate the base turn when abeam the rollout point. You may estimate this position by starting
         the turn when your wingtip is at the end of the runway when viewed from the cockpit. Lower the nose to 8–
         10° and fly the turn at 11° AoA.
5.       Final Turn. Use your throttle to control airspeed while using the stick maintain 8–10° nose low and 11°
         AoA through the turn. Roll out on final and raise the nose to maintain proper glide path. The goal is to roll
         out in line with the runway at approximately 300 feet AGL one mile from the touchdown point. Align the
         HUD flight path marker and 2.5° pitch ladder with the runway threshold to ensure proper glidepath while
         maintaining 11° AoA.
6.   Short Final. When over the overrun, the portion of the runway before the primary surface starts, shift the
     flight path marker forward to a point 300-500 down the runway. Gently pull back on the stick to flare and
     reduce the descent rate but do not level off. Pull the throttle back to idle and touchdown with a maximum
     AoA of 13°. More than 15° during the landing roll-out may cause the speedbrakes or engine nozzle to
     contact the runway so use gentle stick inputs to avoid overcontrolling the aircraft.
7.   Roll-Out. Maintain 13° nose-up attitude for two-point aerodynamic braking until your airspeed has reduced
     to approximately 100 knots. Reduce back stick pressure and lower the nosewheel to the runway. Open the
     speedbrakes fully and maintain full aft stick for maximum braking effectiveness.
     Apply moderate to heavy braking to slow the aircraft. Engage nosewheel steering when below 30 knots
     unless it is required earlier to prevent departure from the runway.


Crosswind Landing
When landing in a crosswind, you should maintain wings-level and allow the aircraft to crab through touchdown.
At touchdown, quickly correct with rudder to maintain alignment down the runway. After touchdown, the aircraft
will want to weathervane into the wind, so you must compensate with rudder use or differential braking. A small
amount of left or right stick into the wind direction may be required to help keep the wings level.
Perform the landing roll-out as described above but maintain two-point aerobraking until below 100 knots or
aircraft control becomes a problem.
High rudder pedal force may cause an abrupt yaw as nosewheel steering is engaged. Center the rudder before
engaging nosewheel steering if possible.
AFTER LANDING
When the aircraft is safely back on the ground it is time to start powering down systems and preparing for
shutdown. These tasks may be performed as you taxi clear of the runway. You may also pull into an arm/de-
arm area to complete the tasks if desired.

Perform the following after coming to a stop in your parking location. This is much simpler than aircraft start-up
because the order is less critical and proper operation of the systems are not being checked.

 1.    Throttle                                                                 Off
       Keyboard Command: [RShift]+[End]
       This terminates ignition and shuts off the fuel supply to the engine. The
       engine spools down and the generator drops offline. Caution and Warning
       lights are to be expected.




 2.    JFS RUN light                                                Confirm Off
       Keyboard Command: N/A




 3.    EPU GEN and EPU PMG lights                                    Confirm off
       Keyboard Command: N/A
       Check after main generator power drops offline. Lights on may indicate
       impending activation of the EPU and a hazardous condition.




 4.    MAIN PWR switch                                                          Off
       Keyboard Command: N/A
       Delay placing MAIN PWR switch to OFF until after engine rpm decreases
       through 20 percent. This delay should allow the exhaust nozzle to remain
       open and makes it easier for the crew chief to accomplish the post flight
       inspection.
5.   OXYGEN REGULATOR                                       Off and 100%
     Keyboard Command: N/A
     This closes the regulator valve and prevents damage from foreign objects
     or small particles entering the system.




6.   Canopy                                                            Open

AIR-TO-AIR MODES
The FCR provides two basic A-A modes for target detection, acquisition, and tracking:
Combined Radar Mode (CRM). This mode combines air-to-air sub-modes used for search under one interface.
Sub-modes are:
     •    Range While Search (RWS)
     •    Track While Scan (TWS)
Air Combat Mode (ACM). This mode combines all sub-modes for automatic target acquisition under one
interface. Sub-modes are:
     •    30° × 20°
     •    Boresight
     •    10° × 60°
     •    Slewable
Single Target Track (STT) is an additional mode entered by locking a target in CRM or ACM sub-modes.
Air-to-Air weapon employment using the radar is discussed in the following sections:
          Air to Air Gunnery
          AIM-9M/X Employment
          AIM-120 Employment
We will first discuss aspects of the radar that spans multiple modes, and then later we will discuss radar
functions specific to unique applications/weapons.
The air-to-air radar display uses a standard B-scope format in which the ownship (your aircraft) is in the bottom
center of the display. As such, all indications on the b-scope are ahead of the ownship. Targets on the scope
are displayed in range from the closest being at the bottom and the more distant being toward the top. Contacts
left and right of the ownship are represented as being indicted left and right of the center of the display to
indicate azimuth.
                                                                                      Control Menu

           and Range




Important, basic components of the display include:
Radar Display Range. The currently selected range displayed on the MFD is shown on the left of the display.
This can be increased or decreased by pressing the adjacent OSBs or by slewing the acquisition cursor to the
top or bottom of the display.
Target Symbols. Target symbols are displayed as solid squares (bricks). The horizonal position of the target
symbol indicates angular position in respect to ownship heading. The vertical position indicates range.
Acquisition Cursor. Consisting of two parallel, vertical lines, this cursor is moved in response to Cursor/Enable
Switch commands. When in a RADAR search mode, the altitude band being covered by the RADAR beam is
indicated above and below the cursor.
Targets are locked by slewing the cursor over the target symbol and commanding TMS Up on your stick.
Range Scale. The right side of the b-scope represents RADAR range. The scale includes marks for ¼, ½, and
¾ of the selected radar range.
Azimuth Setting. Indicates the azimuth setting, in tens of degrees. A setting of “A6” means the radar is
scanning 60° to either side of boresight, which is the maximum scan azimuth. Options are A6, A3, and A1.
Azimuth setting will be A1 during the RWS acquisition process. Higher azimuth settings will result in a longer
detection period and a slower refresh rate.
Elevation Setting. Indicates the elevation area scanned, in number of bars. A setting of “4B” means the radar
is sweeping four different elevations (corresponding to a 40° elevation range). Options are 4B, 2B, and 1B.
Higher elevation settings will result in a longer detection period and a slower refresh rate.
Antenna Azimuth and Elevation Caret. The current radar azimuth is shown by a T symbol on the bottom of
the display. The current radar elevation is shown by a T symbol on the left of the display. The carats move
along scales that show the full ±60⁰ sweep range of the antenna.
Ownship Bearing and Range. This shows the bearing and range from your own aircraft to the Bullseye.
Control Menu. Pressing this OSB takes you to the control menu. See Control (CNTL) .
Radar modes are selected by pressing the OSB adjacent to the current mode (OSB1). After pressing this OSB,
a menu of all available air-to-air modes is displayed on the left side of the display. Press the OSB adjacent to
the desired mode to select it.


                Radar Mode




             Mode Selections




Combined Radar Mode (CRM)
This mode is selected by default at power-up. It is designed to reduce pilot workload by combining air-to-air
sub-modes used for search under one interface. Sub-modes are:
     •    Range While Search (RWS)
               o    Situational Awareness Mode (SAM)
               o    Dual Target Track (DTT)
     •    Track While Scan (TWS)
     •    Single Target Track (STT)
The RWS and TWS sub-modes may be cycled by pressing OSB 2 adjacent to the sub-mode.
               Radar Mode


             Radar Sub-
             mode




You can also cycle between RWS and TWS by holding TMS right for more than one second.




                                                                   Target Management
                                                                   Switch




Range While Search (RWS) Sub-mode
The Range While Search (RWS) sub-mode is used for fast, long-range acquisition and engagement. The pilot
can set the acquisition range (10, 20, 40, 80, or 160 nautical miles) and change the azimuth width and
elevation.
Targets may be acquired and tracked in three ways: Situational Awareness Mode (SAM), Dual Target Track
(DTT), or Single Target Track (STT).
•   Situational Awareness Mode (SAM). Placing the acquisition cursor over a target and pressing TMS
    forward commands SAM. The antenna will be directed to the cursor position and a 4-bar, ±10° spotlight
    scan will be performed while TMS forward is held.
                                                                                  Acquisition Cursor
                 Target



        Spotlight Scan




If a target is not under the acquisition cursor when TMS forward is released or no target is detected, the
scan coverage reverts to the previous scan pattern. The SAM acquisition sequence will only commence if
a target was under the TDC when TMS forward was pressed.
After a successful acquisition, the radar enters SAM mode, with the target bugged. The radar will continue
a scan pattern, pausing to dwell on the bugged target periodically. An AIM-120 AMRAAM will guide on the
bugged target even without an STT lock.




       Additional Target

                                                                                  DLZ
         Bugged Target


        Scan Limit Lines




If a missile is selected (AIM-9 or AIM-120), the DLZ will be displayed along the right edge.
    SAM mode may be exited with TMS aft. Positioning the acquisition cursor over the bugged target and
    pressing TMS forward commands Single Target Track. Positioning the acquisition cursor over another
    target and pressing TMS forward commands Dual Target Track.
•   Dual Target Track (DTT). Dual Target Track is entered from SAM by bugging a second target. In DTT
    mode, the radar will dwell on two targets while continuing a scan pattern centered around the secondary
    target. If the primary target closes within 10 NM of the aircraft, the scan pattern is inhibited, and the radar
    will “ping-pong” between the two bugged targets.




                                                                                            Primary Target
      Additional Target


        Secondary
        Target




    In DTT, pressing TMS left will swap the primary and secondary targets. The radar will shift its scan pattern
    to be centered around the new secondary target. AIM-120 launches in DTT will track the primary target.
•   Single Target Track (STT). Placing the acquisition cursor over a primary bugged target and pressing TMS
    forward commands Single Target Track mode. Placing the acquisition target over a non-bugged target and
    pressing TMS up twice in quick succession accomplishes the same function.
    In STT, the radar focuses all its energy on a single target and provides high-resolution and high-frequency
    updates. However, the radar does not scan, and will no longer detect other contacts. If the enemy has a
    RWR onboard, it will be alerted to the STT lock.
                                                                                       Closure Rate
              Aspect Angle
                                                                                       Airspeed
              Ground Track




              Locked Target




     STT mode may be exited with TMS aft. TMS Aft once returns to SAM mode with the target bugged. TMS
     Aft twice returns to the previous CRM mode.
     This mode is discussed in the Single Target Track (STT) section below.


Track While Scan (TWS) Sub-mode
TWS mode is a multi-target tracking mode. In TWS, the radar will initially detect only hits, like RWS. However,
as successive hits in proximity are detected in subsequent scans, the radar will attempt to combine these hits
into targets. Each detected target is represented by a trackfile, which stores a history of detected hits. This
history is used to build a picture of the target’s heading, speed, and other properties.
TWS has several restrictions. The radar will attempt to build trackfiles for each contact, but given a large scan
volume, there will be a sizable refresh time between scans. During each scan the radar will try to predict the
position of the contact for the next scan. If, however, the target takes evasive, high-G maneuvers and quickly
changing its trajectory and speed, the radar can lose the track by making an incorrect trackfile prediction, and
the contact will disappear from the radar, replaced only with a hit on the next scan.
TWS, when combined with the AIM-120, provides a powerful ability to engage multiple targets quickly.
Nevertheless, target tracking is not as reliable as SAM, and especially less reliable than STT. Unlike STT
though, a TWS lock does not trigger an elevated RWR indication. As such, the first warning the enemy pilot will
likely get is when the radar seeker of the AIM-120 goes active.
Trackfiles are automatically established on up to 10 targets based on information received from each radar
sweep. The radar scan volume options are identical to those used for RWS but are reduced to 3-bar, ±25° when
a target is designated.
Four types of target symbols are available to help sort contacts. They are, in increasing order of importance:
Search Target, Track Target, System Target, and Bugged Target. In addition, two other target symbols can
appear: Cursor Target and Locked Target.
Search Target. These are radar hits that have not been resolved well enough to build a track. They are
displayed as a small brick in much the same way as in RWS.
These targets disappear after a few sweeps if a track cannot be obtained. If a valid track is obtained, usually
after being detected on two consecutive sweeps, the contact automatically becomes a Track Target.
Track Target. Once enough information about a Search Target has been received to build a trackfile, it is
upgraded to a Track Target. These targets are displayed as a larger brick with a velocity vector line showing
their direction of travel. Their altitude is displayed just below each contact. Up to 10 of these tracks may be
present at one time.




                                                                                       Track Target
              Search Targets




Track targets can be considered the most basic radar contact. Other options become available after a trackfile
has been established. The pilot can upgrade any Track Targets of interest to System Targets.
System Target. System Targets are Track Targets designated by the pilot. System Targets are not given any
additional radar energy; the System Target feature is only used by the pilot to designate those targets that the
pilot may wish to monitor or employ weapons against later.
To upgrade a Track Target to a System Target, position the radar cursor over a Track Target and press TMS
Forward. If no System Targets have yet been designated, pressing TMS Right upgrades all Track Targets to
System Targets.
                                                                                        System Target




You can position the acquisition cursor over any System Target to increase its scan priority, making it a Cursor
Target.




                                                                                       Cursor Target




             Scan Limit Lines




The radar will limit its scan to a 3-bar, ±25° pattern centered on that target to provide faster updates and reduce
the chance of losing the Cursor Target. This does not designate the target for AIM-120 employment, only
increases its priority for radar updates.
The Cursor Target can be changed by slewing the cursor to another system target. Slewing away from all
system targets returns the radar to a normal TWS scan.
A System Target can be designated as the Bugged Target by placing the radar cursor over it and pressing
TMS Forward. This changes the scan to a 3-bar, ±25° pattern centered on the bugged target to provide faster
updates and reduce the chance of losing the track.




                                                                                        Bugged Target




              Scan Limit Lines




The Bugged Target is also selected for weapons employment. AIM-9 and AIM-120 DLZ information in the HUD
and FCR format references the Bugged target.
TMS Right will select the closest System Target as the bugged target. Subsequent presses of TMS Right will
cycle through all displayed System Target in range order, making each the Bugged Target in turn.
The Bugged Target can be transitioned to an STT lock by pressing TMS Forward with the cursor over the
Bugged Target. This will transition the radar to STT mode.
Pressing TMS Aft downgrades a Bugged Target to a System Target, or a System Target to a Tracked Target.


Air Combat Mode (ACM)
The Air Combat Mode (ACM) automatically acquires aircraft at short ranges. This mode is used most often
when the target is already acquired visually. The pilot flies the aircraft to position the target in the proper
position for radar acquisition.
Different scan patterns are available in the four different sub-modes:
•    Boresight (BORE)
•    10° × 60° (Vertical Scan)
•    30° × 20° (HUD Scan)
•    Slewable
The radar locks the first target it detects within each sub-mode’s search pattern. Maximum acquisition range is
10 nautical miles. Each sub-mode has its own strengths and weaknesses and is best used in different
situations.
ACM may be entered in two ways:
    •    Position the Dogfight/Missile Override (DOGFIGHT) Switch to DGFT. This selects ACM automatically.
         Or,
    •    Press the OSB next to the radar mode and select ACM from the options on the left of the screen.


                Radar Mode




          Mode Selection




The 30° × 20° sub-mode is entered in a non-radiating (NO RAD) state by default when ACM mode is selected.
The radar is activated when a sub-mode is selected by either cycling through sub-modes on the MFD or using
the Target Management Switch (TMS).




          Sub-mode Selection




HOTAS functions of the TMS in ACM radar mode and the radar as SOI are:
                                                                       Target Management
                                                                       Switch




     •    TMS Up: Boresight (BORE) Sub-mode
     •    TMS Down: 10° × 60° (Vertical Scan)
     •    TMS Right: 30° × 20° (HUD Scan)
     •    TMS Left: No function


30° × 20° (HUD Scan) Sub-mode
The 30° × 20° HUD scan pattern searches an area slightly larger than the HUD field of view. The lock range is
10 nautical miles. The radar automatically locks on to the first target in this zone. When locked, the target is
automatically tracked in STT mode.
There is no special HUD symbology for this sub-mode. The FCR format will display “ACM 20.”




                Scan Zone




This sub-mode is less precise than the BORE sub-mode and may take longer to achieve a lock because of the
larger target area for the radar scan to cover.
Boresight (BORE) Sub-mode
The BORE scan pattern searches a small one-beamwidth area located 3° below the HUD’s gun cross. An
additional Boresight Cross is displayed on the HUD at the center of the radar scan zone to aid in positioning
the target in the radar beam.
The FCR format will display “ACM BORE.”




               Scan Zone


              BORE Cross




BORE is useful for quickly locking a target within visual range (WVR) and allows a degree fine control as to the
target being locked. The first target detected within 20 nautical miles is locked and automatically tracked in STT
mode.


10° × 60° (Vertical Scan) Sub-mode
In the 10° × 60° vertical scan sub-mode, the radar searches an area with 10° in width and 60° in the vertical.
The scan center is 23° above the HUD’s gun cross. This mode is indicated by a vertical line extending from the
gun cross to the bottom of the HUD.
The FCR format will display “ACM 60.”
                 HUD Line




                Scan Zone




The lock range is 10 nautical miles. The radar automatically locks on to the first target in this zone. When
locked, the target is automatically tracked in STT mode.
This mode is most often used during air combat maneuvering (ACM) dogfights. During such fights, you are
often trying to place the target on the lift vector and “pull” the target into the HUD. When in this mode, you can
often lock on to the target earlier, even when it is well above the HUD frame.


Slewable Sub-mode (later in early access)
The scan pattern is approximately 20° high × 60° wide. When selected, the scan is centered directly in front of
the aircraft on the horizon. The scan is slewable via the CURSOR/ENABLE control until a target is acquired.
The amount of slew is limited by the radar gimbal limits.
The FCR format will display “ACM SLEW.”
As with the other sub-modes, the radar automatically locks on to the first target in this zone. When locked, the
target is automatically tracked in STT mode.
This mode is useful when you have a direction to look, for example ‘bandits 2 o’clock high’, but have not picked
them up visually yet.


Single Target Track (STT) Mode
After you have locked the target from RWS or ACM sub-modes, the radar will change to STT mode. The radar
now focuses all its energy on a single target and provides constant updates. However, the radar will no longer
detect other contacts and the enemy may be alerted by this radar lock.
The MFD display in STT mode remains much the same as RWS mode with these differences: The locked
radar target is displayed as a circled triangle symbol with a flight vector line. The target’s altitude is displayed
below the target symbol. The top of the display shows aspect angle, ground track (direction the contact is
traveling over the ground), calibrated airspeed, and closure rate.

Channel. Selects the frequency channel the radar uses, 1 through 4 (not implemented). Different aircraft within
a flight should use different channels to avoid radar interference with each other.
Frequency Agility Band. Toggles between wide (WIDE) and narrow (NARO) frequency agility bandwidth (not
implemented). Frequency agility refers to the radar’s technique of randomly hopping between different
frequencies within the agility band, to increase the difficulty of being jammed.
Power Management. Not implemented.
Radar Level. Not implemented.
Target History. Sets the number of frames that a radar return lives (default 3). When set to 1, a radar return is
only displayed during the frame that it is detected. When set to 2, 3, or 4, the radar return is displayed for
additional scan frames, becoming dimmer with each new frame. By setting the target history, you can get a
broad idea of target relative bearing, since the frames will appear to form a line.
Altitude Tracker. Toggles on and off the altitude line tracker/blanker (not implemented). When on, blanks all
targets which are detected at the range of the altitude line.
Moving Target Rejection. Sets the minimum relative velocity that a detected aircraft must have before it is
displayed (Doppler gate). Not implemented.


Expand (EXP) Feature
The radar provides the ability to enter an expanded field of view display that allows sorting and resolution of
closely grouped contacts. This can be thought of as a zoom feature that provides a 4:1 scale view centered
around the radar cursor. This feature is available in all radar modes.
The expanded display may be toggled on or off by selecting the OSB next to NORM/EXP or by pressing the
Expand/FOV Button (pinky switch) while the FCR is sensor of interest.
                                                                             Normal Display

IFF Interrogation
The Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system allows interrogation of aircraft to determine if they are friendly or
hostile. This is done by transmitting a coded signal aimed at a specific radar contact or volume of space within
the selected radar azimuth and elevation. Transponders in friendly aircraft receive this signal and reply with the
correct coded response.
Contacts are classified based on the response and symbols identifying contacts as friendly or hostile are
displayed on the radar screen. The IFF system is not radar dependent so interrogation of contacts is still
possible with the radar off.
The IFF Master Switch must be set to NORM or LOW on the IFF panel to enable IFF interrogation.


   Master Switch




Interrogation is initiated by HOTAS command in one of two modes:
     •     Scan. Press TMS Left short (1 second or less) to interrogate all contacts in the radar scan volume.
     •     Line of Sight (LOS). Press TMS Left long (more than 1 second) to interrogate the locked target or
           immediate area around the radar cursor.




                                                                        Target Management

If the contact is friendly a green circle is drawn around the contact for three seconds. If no reply is received, no
indication is displayed, and the contact is classified as unknown. These contacts may be assumed to be hostile
depending on the rules of engagement (ROE) in your current scenario.

AIR-TO-GROUND MODES
The air-to-ground radar operates in six different selectable modes:
     •    Ground Map (GM)
     •    Ground Moving Target (GMT)
     •    Sea Search (SEA)
In addition, there are three additional modes that the radar uses in certain situations:
     •    Fixed Target Track (FTT)
     •    Air-to-Ground Ranging (AGR)
     •    Situational Awareness Mode (SAM)
Currently, the GM and SEA sub-modes are selectable.


Ground Mapping (GM) Mode
The Ground Mapping mode is a B-scope raster scan of terrain ahead of the aircraft. Image intensity is a
function of the strength of a radar return. Certain ground features will have higher intensity (e.g., buildings or
vehicles) and others will have lower intensity (e.g., water). Terrain or tall structures will impede the radar beam
from traveling further, creating distinctive shadows, giving the resulting image the appearance of an elevation
relief map.
Normally, the radar only scans the area around the SPI, regardless of aircraft location or heading. If the SPI
moves outside the radar field of view, the radar antenna is boresighted. To scan directly ahead of the aircraft
instead, use Snowplow (SP) Mode.
The ground mapping mode operates in one of four sub-modes:
     •    NORM: Normal mode
     •    EXP: Expanded mode, a 4:1 expansion of the NORM scan area.
     •    DBS1: Doppler beam sharpening mode level 1. The DBS mode can create a higher-resolution image
          than the enhanced ground mapping mode, though it takes longer to render the image. DBS level 1
          produces a 24:1 sharpening. The rendered area is the same size as EXP mode.
     •    DBS2: Doppler beam sharpening mode level 2. Level 2 creates an even sharper image, at 64:1, but
          raster takes three times longer than DBS1. The rendered area depends on range to target, with a
          minimum of 8 NM square.

Radar Mode. Pressing this OSB displays the radar mode menu. Radar modes will be displayed along the right
side and can be selected with the adjacent OSB. Only GM and SEA are available currently.
Sub-Mode. Cycles between NORM, EXP, DBS1, and DBS2 sub-modes. See Expanded Sub-Modes, below.
Override Mode. When highlighted, places the radar in standby mode and suppresses radar transmission.
Range. Pressing these OSBs moves between the radar range options: 80, 40, 20, and 10 NM.
Auto/Manual Range. Pressing this OSB toggles between AUTO and MAN (manual) range control. When in
AUTO mode, moving the crosshairs to the top or bottom of the display increases or decreases the range. The
label displays the mode that will be set if the OSB is pressed: AUTO is displayed when manual mode is active,
and MAN is displayed when automatic mode is active.
Gain Indicator. The scale indicates the range of possible radar gain values. The caret indicates the current
radar gain. Radar gain is adjusted with the GAIN rocker to the left. Higher gain values will produce a brighter
image but may wash out details.
Scan Width. Press to cycle between azimuth width options. The radar will only scan inside that azimuthal area.
Options are A6 (60° to each side of center), A2 (20° to each side), and A1 (10° to each side). Decreasing scan
azimuth will increase refresh rate but hinder situational awareness.
RBM/EGM. Toggles between Real Beam Mode (RBM) or Enhanced Ground Map (EGM). RBM uses raw radar
data to quickly produce an image. EGM uses post-processing to improve the image resolution but takes longer
to render an image. When EGM is on, only the center portion of the radar image is post-processed. EGM is not
available at large bank angles.
Crosshairs. The crosshairs indicate the current sensor point of interest (SPI). When not in snowplow mode, the
Cursor Enable control can be used to move the crosshairs and change the SPI.
B/R to SPI. Displays the bearing and range from the aircraft’s position to the SPI.
Time to Go. Displays the time (minutes:seconds) until reaching the SPI.
Control Page. Pressing displays the Control menu. See Control (CNTL) Menu.
Freeze. Pressing this OSB puts the radar in standby mode and freezes the current radar image on the display.
See Freeze (FZ) Function, below.
Snowplow. Pressing this OSB moves the crosshairs to the center of the display and causes the radar to scan
in front of the aircraft, regardless of its location relative to the SPI. See Snowplow (SP) Mode, below.
Cursor Zero. Pressing this OSB resets all cursor slew. See Sensor Point of Interest (SPI).
Sighting Option. Toggles between different sighting options. The selected sighting option determines the
relationship between the current steerpoint and the SPI. (Not implemented.)
     •    STP. SPI is the current steerpoint. Default in NAV master mode.
     •    TGT. SPI is the designated target (or the current steerpoint if no target is designed). Default in A-G
          master mode.
     •    OA1. SPI is Offset Aimpoint 1 for the current steerpoint.
     •    OA2. SPI is Offset Aimpoint 2 for the current steerpoint.
     •    RP. SPI is the Visual Reference Point for the current steerpoint (see Using Visual Reference Points).
     •    IP. SPI is the Visual Initial Point for the current steerpoint (see Using Visual Initial Points).
     •    SP (sensor point). Displayed when TMS Forward is pressed. SPI is the location designated on the
          FCR format.

When in GM mode, pressing TMS forward designates a target (see Fixed Target Track (FTT)). Pressing TMS
aft undesignates that target.
Pressing the pinky switch cycles between the different sub-modes (NORM, EXP, DBS1, and DBS2).
Expanded Sub-Modes
The expanded sub-modes cannot resolve radar information directly ahead of the aircraft’s nose. When using an
expanded sub-mode, only off-azimuth radar data will be shown.
When in an expanded sub-mode, the crosshairs are fixed at the center of the screen, and using the Cursor
Enable control slews the image, not the crosshairs.




       Yardstick




Yardstick. Indicates a ¼ nautical mile distance.


Freeze (FZ) Function
When OSB7 is pressed, the Freeze function is activated. The radar image will freeze. If the radar continues to
maintain line of sight to the imaged area, the image will continue to refresh with subsequent scans, though the
location and bounds of the image will not change. If the radar loses LOS, it will coast, and the last scanned
composite image will be preserved on the display.

Crosshairs. Used to designate a target. Controlled by the Cursor Enable control. When the radar is coasting,
the crosshair center is displayed as a hollow box. When the radar is actively scanning the crosshair area, the
crosshairs center is displayed as a filled triangle.
Ownship. Displays the location of the aircraft within the radar image. Not displayed if the aircraft is outside the
radar image dimensions.
Bearing and Distance to Crosshairs. Displays the bearing and distance from the present position
(represented by the ownship) to the crosshairs.
Crosshair Coordinates. Displays latitude and longitude of crosshair position. Holding TMS aft temporarily
blanks this text.


Fixed Target Track (FTT)
When a location is designated with TMS Forward, the radar enters FTT sub-mode. This sub-mode has identical
symbology and operation to the FZ (Freeze) function, described above, although the radar beam remains
locked on the designated location and is no longer used to create a raster image.
FTT is appropriate for tracking fixed ground targets or slow-moving sea targets such as ships. To track moving
land targets or fast-moving sea targets, use Ground Moving Target (GMT) mode (will be implemented later).
When in FTT, the designated location becomes the SPI. The radar will continue to track the target location while
line-of-sight is maintained. If LOS is lost, the radar will coast for 10 seconds before the radar returns to GM or
SEA mode. If the designated location moves outside the radar field of view, the radar will slew to boresight until
the target returns into the radar FOV, at which point the radar will reacquire the target. If the target remains
outside the radar FOV for 60 seconds, the radar will return to GM or SEA.
                                                                                        Situational

Situational Awareness Cue. The point about which the map has been expanded.


Snowplow (SP) Mode
In Snowplow mode, the radar scans directly ahead of the aircraft, independent of the SPI location. The radar
cursor is fixed at the center of the display.
Pressing TMS Forward while in Snowplow mode ground-stabilizes the cursor and exits Snowplow mode. You
can then either designate a target, or press Cursor Zero (CZ) if desired to reset the cursor to the steerpoint
location.


Sea Search (SEA) Mode
SEA mode works identically to GM mode (see above). SEA mode is appropriate for tracking slow-moving or
stationary objects on the water’s surface.

LINK 16 DATALINK
OVERVIEW
The aircraft relies on the Multifunction Information Distribution System (MIDS) radios that allow the transmission
and reception of data over the Link 16 Tactical Data Information Link (TADIL) network. Link 16 allows NATO
and other services to share data with each other.
Link 16 is part of the MIDS radio system and must be activated by rotating the MIDS LVT knob on the Avionics
Power Panel to the ON position. The DL switch next to the knob is not applicable to this block of the F-16C and
may be left OFF if desired.




The primary purpose of Link 16/MIDS is to provide a near-real-time picture of the tactical area around the pilot’s
aircraft. Data from ownship sensors, other friendly fighters on the network, and surveillance assets like AWACS
are correlated to create a unified situational awareness picture. This in turn allows a more coordinated
engagement and less chance of fratricide.
DISPLAY SYMBOLOGY
Each trackfile is represented by a symbol on the HSD and Radar Display. Depending on the shape and color,
you can determine whether it is friendly or hostile, and what the source of the track is; onboard systems,
offboard donors, or a combination of the two.




                                                                                       Friendly Tracks

Symbol. The basic symbol changes shape and color to represent different information. See below for
examples.
Vector Line. This line points in the direction the track is heading.
Altitude. This displays the track’s altitude in thousands of feet
The Radar Display presents the information in much the same way as the HSD but includes an additional
identifier when a target is ‘bugged’ as the primary target by another donor aircraft on the network. This is a great
aid to target sorting as it allows the pilot to prioritize targets not being engaged by other aircraft in the area.

The Bugged Target ID shows the aircraft that is currently targeting a hostile track and may be interpreted as
follows:
1, 2, 3, or 4. These identify the member of the pilot’s flight that is currently bugging the target.
FD11, EN23, CY14, etc. The first and last letters of the callsign and flight position number is displayed when a
target is bugged by a donor that is not a member of the pilot’s flight. For example, FD11 identifies Ford 11,
CY14 identifies Chevy 41, and so on.
M. The target is bugged by multiple donors.
Bugged targets are identified differently on the HSD than on the radar display. A dashed cyan Wingman
Lockline is drawn from wingmen to their currently bugged targets. Wingman Locklines are only displayed for
flight members and not for all donors on the network.
Bugged Target IDs are shown on the radar display only and Wingman Locklines are displayed on the HSD only.

Radar Display Filtering
Track symbols displayed on the FCR page may be filtered using the UHF/VHF Transmit switch. This affects
tracks displayed on the radar display only and does not affect those displayed on the HSD.

                                                                                 UHF VHF Transmit Switch




Positioning the switch inboard short (less than .5 sec) rotates between three filter options:
     •    ALL. All symbols are displayed
     •    FTR+. Surveillance tracks are removed
     •    TGTS. Surveillance and PPLI tracks are removed
Positioning the switch outboard short (less than .5 sec) selects NONE and removes all datalink tracks.
Selecting outboard short again returns to the previously selected filter option.
The current option is displayed at the bottom left of the radar display.




                 Filter Option
DLNK DED PAGES
Three datalink (DLNK) pages are available on the DED to monitor and verify configuration of the Link 16

LITENING AT TARGETING
         POD
OVERVIEW
The targeting pod provides you the ability to view, track, or designate targets day or night. There are two live
video modes: Charge Coupled Device (CCD) (like a TV display) and Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) in both
Black Hot and White Hot sub-modes.
The main function modes and sub-modes for the TGP include:
     •    Standby (STBY)
     •    Air-to-Ground (A-G)
                o     Slave (Ground)
                o     AREA Track
                o     POINT Track
                o     INR Track
                o     Laser Spot Search (LSS)
     •    Air-to-Air (A-A)
     •    Slave (Body)
                o     POINT Track
                o     RATE Track
                o     HUD
Each of these modes also has a Control Page that provides you with the ability to configure TGP features.
TGP ACTIVATION
The following switches must be set on the Avionics Power Panel for all TGP features to function:
     •    MMC switch – MMC
     •    ST STA switch – ST STA
     •    MFD switch – MFD
     •    UFC switch – UFC
     •    INS – NORM
Power is applied to the TGP from the Sensor Control Panel:
     •    RIGHT HDPT switch – RIGHT HDPT
Select TGP from the MFD Menu to access the TGP page.




          TGP Page Select




When the TGP is initially activated, the Standby page will be displayed with a “NOT TIMED OUT” message
displayed in the upper center portion. Time is needed to run automatic power-up self-tests and for the FLIR
sensor to cool down.
A “FLIR HOT” message is displayed in white text on a black background with half the text height as the “NOT
TIMED OUT” message. After about three minutes, the message will be removed, video will appear, and the
Standby mode page will be selected.
STANDBY (STBY) MODE
This will be the first TGP mode screen displayed upon activation of the TGP. After the “NOT TIMED OUT”
message has been removed (after 3 minutes), the mode may be exited by selecting one of the other two TGP
modes or the standby control page.
The following OSB functions may be displayed:



                                                                                    Override Select

                o      Narrow Field of View (NFOV) is 1° by 1°
Zoom Factor. Within an FOV selection, you may additionally adjust the zoom-factor by zooming in and out with
the RANGE knob. The zoom range goes from 0Z (no zoom) to 9Z (highest level of zoom within FOV). Objects
within the TGP field of view double in size from 0 to 9 zoom.
AGM-65 Handoff Sub-mode. This OSB toggles between MAN and AUTO for AGM-65D/G Maverick hand off
mode.
     •      MAN. The AGM-65 will be slaved to the Line of Sight of the TGP but will not automatically be handed
            off the lock. Pilot must manually change SOI to AGM-65 and command lock manually.
     •      AUTO. TMS right will hand off the lock to the AGM-65 if the target contrast and size meets criteria of
            missile lock.
Current Mode. This is the mode the TGP is currently in.
SPI Coordinates/Elevation. The lat/lon coordinates and elevation in feet of the current System Point of Interest
(SPI) is displayed. This is usually the point in the center of the crosshairs at ground level.
Grayscale. When pressed, it displays a 10-stage gray scale bar at the bottom of the display. When enabled,
the label changes to GRAY ON.
Situational Awareness Cue. The SA cue provides you a reference to indicate the TGP’s current line of sight in
reference to the pod’s longitudinal (boresight) axis, which is coincidental with the aircraft longitudinal axis. The
cue is represented as a small square that can move to any spot within the display. The position of the SA
square represents the current TGP line of sight.
Gain Control. Pressing this OSB toggles between manual and automatic gain control for the FLIR video.
     •    MGC. If selected, level control arrows are displayed on the OSBs below (not shown). Gain may be
          controlled with the physical gain rocker switch on the top left of the MFD. The current selected gain is
          indicated on the top left corner of the TGP page (not shown).
     •    AGC. Gain is adjusted automatically, and the level control arrows and gain indicator are both
          removed.
Note: The AGC/MGC label and associated OSB labels are displayed even if the TGP is in TV mode.
Crosshairs. Line of sight for targeting and laser fire.
Field of View (FOV) Indicators. These four corner brackets are only shown when WIDE FOV is enabled and
indicate the portion of the image that will be displayed if NARO FOV is enabled.
Track Mode. If the TGP is in a track mode, this field will indicate the track mode it is in. Types include:
     •    AREA. In AREA track mode, the TGP performs image correlation to track an overall scene. AREA
          track mode is effective at tracking fixed objects.
     •    POINT. In POINT track mode, the TGP attempts to follow the centroid of a visible object using edge
          detection. POINT track mode is effective at tracking moving objects that are well-defined against their
          background, either because they are warmer (in HOC/COH sub-modes) or brighter (TV sub-mode).
     •    INR (inertial rates). In INR mode, the TGP maintains its LOS on a position using only inertial
          integration. It does not do any image processing. INR track mode is effective at approximately
          maintaining the TGP LOS when the target is at risk of being masked or obscured.
Slant Range to SPI. This indicates the slant range in nautical miles to the SPI. The preceding letter indicates
the source of the range data.
     •    L. Laser (priority over all other sources)
     •    T. TGP passive ranging
     •    (blank). Sensor that is not the TGP is providing range (for example, FCR A-G ranging)
Laser Code. If the laser is firing (flashing L), the targeting pod laser code being used should display the code
as set on the LASR DED page. This is an octal value of 1 to 8 with a range between 1111 and 2888.
                                                                                     Override Select

OVRD Select. Pressing this OSB overrides any current mode and returns to STBY. The last selected mode is
returned to when OVRD is selected a second time.
A-G Control Page Select. Pressing this OSB selects the STBY Control Page.
Radar Altitude. The current radar altitude is displayed.
Sensor Type. Displayed in the upper right corner, this text field indicates the current video mode that the TGP
is collecting in. The three options include:
     •    WHOT. Using the FLIR camera, hot objects appear lighter than a cooler background.
     •    BHOT. Using the FLIR camera, hot objects appear darker than a cooler background.
     •    TV. The Charge Coupled Device camera displays this image. This is a daytime, electro-optical
          camera.
North Arrow. The north arrow cue consists of the letter N with an arrow, displayed on the top right corner of the
TGP base page. The arrow points to magnetic north in 1.4° increments relative to the TGP cross hairs line of
sight.
Laser Spot Search Code. This is the laser pulse rate frequency (PRF) code the TGP will attempt to locate in
laser spot search (LSS) mode.
Track Polarity. For either FLIR or TV, pressing this OSB toggles between Neutral Track (NT) and White Track
(WT). When TV is selected, the OSB cycles between NT, WT, and Black Track (BT).
     •    NT mode allows both white and black targets to be point tracked. This is the default A-G mode.
     •    WT only allows white point targets to be tracked. This is the default A-A mode
     •    BT allows black point targets to be tracked.
Pressing this OSB twice within 0.5 seconds toggles the Laser Spot Tracker (LST) function on and off.
Snowplow Mode. This mode is available in NAV and A-G modes while the TGP is not tracking. This mode is
available when SP is displayed adjacent to the OSB (not shown). When SP is pressed, both the FCR and TGP
are commanded to snowplow mode.
In snowplow mode, the TGP LOS is commanded straight ahead and angled downwards to point to the ground
ahead at ½ of the currently selected FCR scale (for example, if selected FCR scale is 40nm, the TGP will look
at the point on the ground 20nm ahead). Because the location determined by the reticle is snowplowing, the SPI
itself will also snowplow.
Slewing is disabled; however, it is possible to ground-stabilize by pressing TMS-fwd. This will exit SP mode and
enter a normal AREA track.
Meterstick. The meterstick is a number to the right of the reticle that indicates the length of the ground under
the crosshair, in meters.
Cursor Zero. Pressing CZ erases the cursor slew and returns the SPI to the currently selected steerpoint.
Sighting Option. This OSB will cycle between TGT-OAP1-OAP2 where OAP is the Offset Aim-Point (OAP)
which can be added to each steer point. An OAP can be useful if the target is obscured by weather, but the
OAP is in the clear. By selecting OAP1 or 2, the TGP slaves to the clear OAP and the aiming can be confirmed,
although the steering and weapon delivery calculations will be to the target.
Laser Status. This displays the current state of the laser designator.
     •    (blank). Laser not armed
     •    L. Laser armed.
     •    Flashing L. Laser firing.
Time to Go. This shows the time to the next event depending on the aircraft status. Time to reach the
steerpoint is displayed if in NAV master mode. Time to release weapon is displayed if in A-G mode if a target
has been designated in an auto-delivery mode. Time to impact is displayed if a weapon has been released.
Weapons delivery using the TGP in A-G mode is covered in the Laser Guided Bombs section.


Track Modes
The LITENING II targeting pod can employ one of three different modes to track a target: AREA, POINT, INR
(inertial rates), and SP (snowplow). Each track mode is suitable for a different situation.
     •    In AREA track mode, the TGP performs image correlation to track an overall scene. AREA track
          mode is effective at tracking fixed objects.
     •    In POINT track mode, the TGP attempts to follow the centroid of a visible object using edge detection.
          POINT track mode is effective at tracking moving objects that are well-defined against their
          background, either because they are warmer (in HOC/COH sub-modes) or brighter (TV sub-mode).
     •    In INR mode, the TGP maintains its LOS on a position using only inertial integration. It does not do
          any image processing. INR track mode is effective at approximately maintaining the TGP LOS when
          the target is at risk of being masked or obscured.
     •    In SP mode, TGP LOS is commanded straight ahead and angled downwards to point to the ground
          ahead at ½ of the currently selected FCR scale (for example, if selected FCR scale is 40nm, the TGP
          will look at the point on the ground 20nm ahead).
Therefore, it is recommended to use AREA track mode for stationary targets and POINT track mode for moving
targets. In situations where the targeting pod is likely to become masked (intensive maneuvering, concealment
behind terrain, or turning away from the target), it’s recommended to first change the TGP to INR track mode to
preserve the LOS as best as possible. SP mode is useful for locating targets directly ahead without reference to
steerpoints or other anchor points loaded into the aircraft.
When the targeting pod is initially brought out of standby, it is not in any track mode. The pilot can move the
targeting pod between track modes using the TMS switch:
            INR MODE                AREA MODE                     POINT MODE                 SP MODE

                  Targeting pod in INR (inertial rates) track mode (crosshair is enlarged)
                                            Targeting pod in AREA track mode




                               Targeting pod in POINT track mode (box encloses track target)

When the TGP cursor is slewed, the targeting pod automatically and temporarily changes to INR track mode.
The previous track mode (AREA or POINT) is re-commanded once slewing stops.


Laser Ranging
One very important feature of the Targeting Pod’s laser designator is the ability to measure the slant range to
the target. The laser is fired and the time it takes to receive the reflected laser energy is measured, providing a
precise range. This information is then fed to the Fire Control Computer to update the stored target elevation
and greatly improve the accuracy of the computed firing solution.
This can and should be done when possible for all weapons delivery types, not just laser guided bombs. To
facilitate this, the TGP automatically slaves to the pipper while in gun, rocket, and bomb CCIP modes, and to
the target designator while in CCRP and DTOS modes.
These weapons delivery modes are discussed fully in the Air-to-Ground Employment section.
To take a laser range, the Laser Arm Switch must be set to ARM. Laser firing is inhibited with the switch set to
OFF.




The Laser status is displayed as an L on the HUD and TGP display when the Laser Arm switch is set to arm.
The laser is fired by squeezing the trigger to the first detent. The L flashes when the laser designator is firing.
Releasing the trigger stops lasing.




                                                     Laser Status
AIR-TO-AIR (A-A) MODE
The TGP is automatically commanded to the radar line-of-sight when A-A master mode is selected, and the
radar is tracking a target. If the radar is not tracking an aerial target, the pod directs its line-of-sight straight
ahead at -3° elevation.
From the boresight, you may slew the TGP crosshair using the CURSOR switch. When slewing, the TGP
camera moves in a space stabilized manner. When in this slewed mode, but not tracking a target, “RATES” is
indicated on the display. After being slewed, the crosshairs will be reduced to half-size.
If the valid air target passes within the narrow field of view area (represented by the four corner markers), the
TGP will attempt to track the target and place a cross “+” on it. If the target flies outside the narrow field of view
area, the cross will disappear.
If you then command TMS Forward Short HOTAS command (command point track), the target will be centered
in the crosshair and a box will be drawn around the target to conform to its size. When in this mode, “POINT”
will be displayed as well as the tracking cross. To exit POINT track, the user may command INR track (TMS
Right) or return to slave mode (TMS Aft).
The following elements may be displayed:


                                                                                           Override Select

Current Mode. This is the mode the TGP is currently in.
Field of View. Pressing this OSB toggles between Narrow Field of View (NFOV) or Wide Field of View
(WFOV). These views can vary between the CCD and FLIR sensors in the TGP.
     •     FLIR field of view:
               o      Wide Field of View (WFOV) is 4° × 4°
               o      Narrow Field of View (NFOV) is 1° × 1°
     •     CCD field of view:
               o      Wide Field of View (WFOV) is 3.5° × 3.5°
               o      Narrow Field of View (NFOV) is 1° × 1°
Zoom Factor. Within an FOV selection, you may additionally adjust the zoom-factor by zooming in and out with
the RANGE knob. The zoom range goes from 0Z (no zoom) to 9Z (highest level of zoom within FOV). Objects
within the TGP field of view double in size from 0 to 9 zoom.
Crosshairs. Line of sight for targeting and laser fire.
Field of View (FOV) Indicators. These four corner brackets are only shown when WIDE FOV is enabled and
indicate the portion of the image that will be displayed if NARO FOV is enabled.
OVRD Select. Pressing this OSB overrides any current mode and returns to STBY. The last selected mode is
returned to when OVRD is selected a second time.
A-G Control Page Select. Pressing this OSB selects the STBY Control Page.
Radar Altitude. The current radar altitude is displayed.
Sensor Type. Displayed in the upper right corner, this text field indicates the current video mode that the TGP
is collecting in. The three options include:
     •    WHOT. Using the FLIR camera, hot objects appear lighter than a cooler background.
     •    BHOT. Using the FLIR camera, hot objects appear darker than a cooler background.
     •    TV. The Charge Coupled Device camera displays this image. This is a daytime, electro-optical
          camera.
Laser Spot Search Code. This is the laser pulse rate frequency (PRF) code the TGP will attempt to locate in
laser spot search (LSS) mode.
Track Mode. If the TGP is in a track mode, this field will indicate the track mode it is in. Types include:
     •    RATES. When in A-A mode and the slew function is released, the TGP will automatically enter
          RATES mode (indicated in the tracking-type field).
     •    POINT. As with A-G mode, the user may command a Point track over an object. This mode is also
          used for radar locked targets.
Situational Awareness Cue. The SA cue provides you a reference to indicate the TGP’s current line of sight in
reference to the pod’s longitudinal (boresight) axis, which is coincidental with the aircraft longitudinal axis. The
cue is represented as a small square that can move to any spot within the display. The position of the SA
square represents the current TGP line of sight.
Weapons delivery using the TGP is covered in the Air to Air Employment section.
HOTAS COMMANDS
The following HOTAS commands are available when the TGP is sensor of interest (SOI):
TMS Fwd. Enters AREA track when pressed, then POINT track when released. If POINT track fails, it remains
in AREA track.
TMS Aft. If TGP is tracking, break track and return to slave mode (e.g., slaved to A/G SPI or A/A FCR line of
sight). If TGP is already in slave mode, cursor zero (i.e., return to boresight position).
TMS Left. Toggle FLIR polarity between white hot and black hot.
TMS Right (Maverick not selected). Enter AREA track mode.
TMS Right (Maverick selected). Attempt Maverick handoff.
Trigger (First Detent). Fire Laser.
Trigger (Second Detent). Fire laser for 30 seconds if in CCIP bombing mode. (See Laser Ranging section.)
Expand/FOV. Toggle FOV between Wide and Narrow.




                                              Trigger                       Target Management
                                                                            Switch (TMS)

Manual Slew. The TGP view can be slewed to scan the scene and search for targets using the cursor controls.
Manual slew is available is either in Slave mode or in one of the tracking sub-modes (e.g., area track or point
track).




                                                                           Cursor/Enable Switch
LASR DED PAGE
The laser code for TGP designation and LST search are set on the LASR DED page.
     1.   Select the LIST page and press 0 to bring up the MISC page.
     2.   Then, press 5 to select the LASR page.




     3.   Type in the new TGP laser code or LST code on the keypad and press ENTR.




The TGP will now fire the laser designator at the new TGP code or search for laser spots with the new LST
code. Position the DCS left to return to the CNI page.
The laser designator on the Targeting Pod must be set to match the code on the bomb. See the section on the
Bomb Seeker Laser Code for procedures.
HELMET-MOUNTED
 CUEING SYSTEM
OVERVIEW
The Helmet Mounted Cuing System (HMCS) is a bolt-on kit to the flight helmet that always allows the pilot to
view aircraft and weapon information on the helmet visor. This is referred to as the Helmet Mounted Display
(HMD).
It also allows the slaving of sensors and weapons to the helmet’s line of sight. This is a particularly effective
system when paired with the AIM-9X high off-boresight dogfight missile. The helmet can slave weapons and
sensor up to 80° off boresight.
Power to the HMD is selected from the HMD control knob on the left auxiliary console. Rotating the knob
clockwise from the OFF position to INC (increase) provides power to the HMD. Continued clockwise rotation
increases HMD brightness.




Symbology on the HMD is only visible in the right eye. This may cause discomfort in VR so you may change the
way it is rendered in the DCS: World options F-16C Special tab. These options are available:




Weapons delivery using the HMCS is covered in the following sections:
AIM-9M/X HMCS Missile BORE Employment
AIM-9M/X HMCS Radar BORE Employment


Alignment
To use the HMCS, it must be aligned prior to takeoff. HMCS alignment is completed for you if the mission
begins with your aircraft already started, but for cold-start missions, you must complete the HMCS alignment
yourself. To align the HMCS, do the following:
     1.   Power on the HMCS by rotating the HMCS knob out of “OFF”.
     2.   Press LIST to show the LIST menu on the DED, then press M-SEL (0) to enter the MISC menu, and
          finally RECALL to enter the HMCS menu.
3.   Press the dobber switch right to view page 2. Verify that the cursors are around the COARSE
     alignment option.




4.   Press M-SEL (0). The coarse alignment cross will be displayed on the HUD and HMD.


                                                                     HMD Alignment
                                                                     Cross


                                                                     HUD Alignment
                                                                     Cross




5.   Move your head to align the two crosses.
6.   While holding your head steady, press and hold the Cursor Enable button on the throttle. “ALIGNING”
     will display on the HUD for about 2.5 seconds. After alignment is complete, the HUD will display
     “ALIGN OK.”
7.   Press M-SEL (0) to advance to the AZ/EL alignment phase. The DX/DY cross will be displayed in the
     HMD, and “FA DX/DY” (fine alignment) will be displayed in the HUD below the alignment cross.
          DX/DY Cross




         DROLL Cross




8.   Use the TDC to align the DX/DY cross with the HUD cross, and then press M-SEL (0).




9.   The cursor will advance to the ROLL phase. Press M-SEL (0) to begin the ROLL alignment.
10. The text in the HUD will change to “FA DROLL.” Use the TDC to rotate the DROLL cross until it’s
    aligned with the bottom portion of the alignment cross.
     11. Once alignment is satisfactory, press M-SEL (0). Alignment mode will exit, and alignment is complete.
After aligning, you can turn off the HMCS using the Power knob if desired.


Non-Designated Mode
The basic features of the HMCS can be illustrated in the non-designated mode. This can be thought of as an
extension of the HUD, with much of the symbology mimicked on the HMD. These features apply to all HMCS
modes:
                 RWR Display


                 Acceleration (G)                                                        Barometric Altitude

                    Master Mode

                                                                                         Distance to Target
                  Bearing/Range
                  to Bullseye

                                                                                         Helmet Heading



Acceleration (G). Duplication of the current G.
Airspeed. Duplication of airspeed from HUD.
Master Arm Status. Master Arm Switch Position: OFF, ARM or SIM.
Master Mode. Current Master Mode.
Bearing/Range to Bullseye. Bearing and range from your aircraft to the Bullseye.
Altitude. Duplication of the HUD barometric altitude.
Dynamic Aiming Cross. While in A/A mode in the HMD, the aiming cross can be in one of three locations on
the HMD, based on HMD view angle.
     •    When HMD LOS is 0° or less above the stabilized horizon, the aiming cross is centered in the HMD.
     •    When HMD LOS is between 0° and 30° above stabilized horizon, the aiming cross is centered
          between the airspeed and altitude indicators on the HMD.
     •    When HMD LOS is greater than 30° above stabilized horizon, the aiming cross is centered above the
          heading tape on the HMD.
Distance to Target. Displays distance to target or steerpoint in nautical miles. Displays “XXX” when no target is
locked.
Helmet Heading. Heading scale and number indicates helmet line of sight heading (not aircraft heading).
RWR Display. Displays the priority RWR threat surrounded by a circle. Plotted on the circle is a diamond
indicating threat direction relative to aircraft nose. (Aircraft nose is at the 12 o’clock position.) The small gap in
the circle indicates helmet LOS direction. When the gap is aligned with the diamond, the pilot’s head is facing
the threat.
The RWR display is blanked when there is no priority threat. The RWR display can also be inhibited from the
LIST→MISC→HMCS page on the DED (see HMCS Page).
AIR-TO-AIR EMPLOYMENT
AIR COMBAT PREPARATION
Remember to anticipate what is coming up next and stay ahead of the curve. You do not have to wait until you
are about to make an attack to set the aircraft up.
When entering an area where you expect to encounter enemy aircraft, you will want to take the following steps:
     1.   Position the Master Arm Switch to ARM. Weapons may be released normally when in the ARM
          position. If the Master Arm switch is placed in the SAFE position, weapon release is inhibited.




     2.   Press the A-A Master Mode Button on the ICP to place the fire control system in Air-to-Air Missile
          (AAM) Mode.




This is one method for preparing the aircraft for an air-to-air attack. There are also two air-to-air override modes
that can be quickly selected using HOTAS commands. Those are described below.
DOGFIGHT AND MISSILE OVERRIDE MODES
Two override modes are available to quickly configure the aircraft for an air-to-air engagement: Dogfight and
Missile Override. These modes are selected using the DOGFIGHT switch located on the throttle grip. It is a
three-position switch that overrides any mode except emergency jettison.




                                                                                     DOGFIGHT Switch




     •    DOGFIGHT (outboard). This mode provides symbology on the HUD for both 20mm gun firing and
          AIM-9 Sidewinder missile delivery.
     •    MSL OVRD (inboard, unlabeled). This provides symbology for AIM-120 missile firing only. If no AIM-
          120 is loaded, AIM-9s are selected.
     •    Center position. Returns to the last selected master mode.
Requests for master mode changes made using the ICP will be ignored while either of these modes are active.
Changes to missile or radar settings made while either override mode is active will be saved throughout the
mission. A common technique is to configure the displays, radar, and missiles for each mode as desired during
ground operations. This provides three distinct weapon delivery options (Dogfight, Missile Override and Default)
without the need to remove your hands from the controls.


Dogfight Mode
With the switch in the DOGFIGHT (outboard) position, the HUD is configured for Gun and AIM-9 missile firing.
The left MFD is configured with the radar in ACM Boresight mode and the right MFD is configured with the
Dogfight SMS page.
The Dogfight HUD combines elements of the Missile and Guns HUD modes into one decluttered display. Note
that the heading bar, flight path marker and attitude bars are removed.

                     Bullseye




See the sections on Air to Air Gunnery and AIM-9 Sidewinder Employment for details on each display and how
to use them.


Missile Override Mode
With the switch in the Missile Override (inboard) position, the HUD is configured for AIM-120 missile firing. The
left MFD is configured with the radar in RWS mode and the right MFD is configured with the Missile SMS page.
See the section on AIM-120 AMRAAM Employment for details on each display and how to use them.
M6A1 20MM CANNON
The M61A1 20mm automatic gun system provides the pilot with a formidable weapon capability. It is a six-barrel
Gatling type gun mounted in the left strake of the aircraft. The system has a capacity of 512 rounds of
ammunition fired at 6,000 rounds per minute.


Gun Dispersion
Rounds fired from any gun system do not follow a perfectly straight path but are dispersed in a cone shaped
pattern after they leave the gun’s muzzle. The dispersion pattern becomes a larger and larger cone as slant
range increases. The density of rounds within the cone becomes less and less as the edge of the cone is
approached.
The average dispersion of the M61A1 is 8 mils diameter for 80% of the rounds fired and 12 mils for 100% of the
rounds fired.1 USAF units maintain a boresight program to ensure gun systems installed on aircraft continue to
meet these specifications while in operational use.
One mil is equal to 1/1000 of a radian so 8 mils equals an 8 foot diameter circle at 1,000 feet range and 12 mils
equals a 12 foot diameter circle. The size of the circle continues to increase with range.




In practical terms, this means you have some leniency in accuracy when firing the gun. In this example, the
green gun pipper is a 4-mil diameter circle. This is where bullets are most dense within the cone. The red
shaded area is the 8-mil circle 80% of the rounds will pass through at the target range. The orange shaded area
is the 12-mil circle that 100% of the rounds will pass through at the target range.




1
  This is based on MIL-DTL-45500/1A that states “At a range of 1,000 inches, 80 percent of a 75 round (min.) burst shall be completely within an 8.0
inch diameter circle for accuracy” and the manufacturer’s data sheet that states “8 milliradians diameter, 80 percent circle”.
The dispersion pattern of rounds fired from the gun is a circle only if the target is perpendicular to the flight path.
It resembles an ellipse when firing against a horizontal target on the ground.




  Summary
          1.       Select A/A master mode [1] or DGFT override mode [3]
          2.       Set Master Arm Switch to Arm
          3.       Acquire target using ACM radar mode (optional)
          4.       Fly the EEGS funnel and pipper onto the target
          5.       Squeeze the Trigger [Space] to the second detent to fire the gun



Air to Air Gunnery
     1.        There are two ways to get into the correct SMS configuration for air-to-air gunnery. They are:
               •     Select the Air-to-Air Gunnery operating mode on the MFD by pressing OSB 1 until GUN is
                     displayed, or
               •     Position the Dogfight/Missile Override (DOGFIGHT) Switch to DGFT.
               This provides symbology on the HUD for both 20mm gun firing and A-A missile delivery.
                                                                                Gun Status

2.   Verify A-A GUN symbology is displayed in the HUD.
     The Enhanced Envelope Gun Sight (EEGS) provides different levels of information depending on
     whether the radar is locked on the target.
     Level I is a failure mode that only displays the Boresight Cross in the event of a Rate Sensor Unit
     (RSU) and INS failure. It should almost never be encountered.
     Level II provides a prediction of the bullet path when there is no radar lock. The Boresight Cross,
     EEGS Funnel and Multiple Reference Gunsight (MRGS) Lines are provided.
     Level III and IV are intermediate levels that lead to the Level V display. These are usually not seen
     by the pilot.
     Level V is displayed after radar lock-on and a firing solution has been computed using that data.
     Additional references in the HUD include the Target Designator, T-Symbol, Range to Target,
     Closure Rate and Level V Pipper.

                           Level II Symbology (no radar lock)

Boresight Cross. This symbol is always available and shows the boresight direction. This is the
direction rounds will travel before other influences like gravity or air resistance take effect.
EEGS Funnel. Each point along the funnel represents the target at a specific range for which the gun
is correctly aimed. In other words, an aircraft whose wings are the same width as the funnel is at the
correct range to be hit by rounds fired at that moment.
As the range decreases, the target size will increase. As this occurs, you must place the target higher
in the funnel to keep the target wingspan just touching the sides of the funnel. This results in placing
the target higher in the HUD or, more importantly, closer to the Boresight Cross which results in
reduced lead for the reduced range.
The target aircraft wingspan must be known for the funnel to provide accurate range information.
Multiple Reference Gunsight Lines. The MRGS sight is composed of a series of five line segments
pointing toward the Gun Bore Line, and spaced in an arc near the bottom of the HUD. They aid in
lining up long range, high aspect shots by providing the correct lateral aiming solution so the target
flies up the funnel.
When using an MRGS line, if the target is smaller than the line, it is either out of range or moving
faster than anticipated and requires extra lead. If the target is larger than the MRGS line, the target is
moving slower than anticipated and will require less lead.

      Target Designator. This symbol is centered on the locked radar target. The triangular Target
      Aspect Caret shows the target’s aspect angle. Maximum effective gun range is shown by an In-
      Range Cue, two small lines on the outside of the symbol. The position of the Target Range Caret
      indicates the range to the locked target. Each o’clock position represents 1,000 feet of range, so:
           •      12 o’clock = 12,000 ft
           •      9 o’clock = 9,000 ft
           •      6 o’clock = 6,000 ft
           •      3 o’clock = 3,000 ft
      Target Range. The distance to the locked target. Tenths of a mile are displayed for ranges greater
      than one mile. Hundreds of feet are displayed at ranges less than one mile.
      Closure Rate. The rate of closure with the target in knots.
      T-Symbol. This symbol shows two firing solutions for the locked target. The + symbol, or ‘one-G
      pipper’ shows the lead angle against a non-maneuvering target. The small horizontal bar, or ‘nine-G
      pipper’ shows the lead angle for a target turning at maximum sustained rate. These may be used as
      a backup in situations the Level V Pipper is not displayed.
      Two maneuver potential lines are displayed on either side of the 1g pipper. The longer the lines, the
      greater the out-of-plane maneuver potential of the target.
      Level V Pipper. This represents the gunfire solution computed for the target’s current range and
      rates. The goal is to stabilize this pipper over the target and fire.
3.   Maneuver your aircraft to frame the target aircraft within the EEGS funnel.
     Each point along the funnel represents the target at a specific range for which the gun is correctly
     aimed. In other words, an aircraft whose wings are the same width as the funnel is at the correct
     range to be hit by rounds fired at that moment.
     Place the enemy aircraft in the funnel so that the wingtips touch the edges or the Level V Pipper is
     stabilized over the target.
4.   Squeeze the trigger all the way to the second detent to fire the gun when the wingtips touch
     the funnel (Level II) or Pipper is over the target (Level V).
     Target range greatly affects gun effectiveness. As the rounds come out of the gun, they will gradually
     disperse and lose velocity. Increased dispersion and loss of velocity reduce the accuracy and
     effectiveness of the gun. The top of funnel represents the minimum range of approximately 600 feet.
     The bottom of the funnel represents the maximum range of approximately 3,000 feet. If the target is
     smaller than the bottom of the funnel, it is out of range.

An additional symbol known as the Bullets at Target Range (BATR) Symbol is displayed after rounds are
fired. The BATR is displayed as the first real or simulated round passes the target range and is removed after
the last round has passed. This is only available with a radar lock and EEGS Level III, IV or V symbology
displayed.




             BATR Symbol
AIM-9M/X SIDEWINDER
The AIM-9 is a short-range, infrared-guided missile best used in a dogfight. It is fire-and-forget and can be used
with or without a radar lock. The primary indication of a seeker lock is a higher-pitched lock tone. The seeker
can also be uncaged to ensure the seeker is tracking the target when it has first been sensor-slaved to the
target.
Note that the AIM-9 can be decoyed by flares and it’s a good idea to ensure you have a good seeker lock
before launching an AIM-9 with flares in the seeker field of view.

          1.       Select AAM [4] or DGFT [3] master mode
          2.       Set Master Arm Switch to Arm
          3.       Acquire target using radar (optional)
          4.       Maneuver until target is in launch zone
          5.       Depress Uncage switch [C] to command missile track (if required)
          6.       Verify missile diamond is on target and lock tone is audible
          7.       Depress Weapon Release [RAlt]+[Space] switch to fire missile



AIM-9M/X Employment
     1.        There are two ways to get into the correct SMS configuration for firing an AIM-9. They are:
               •      Select AIM-9s on the MFD by pressing OSB 7 until AIM-9s are displayed, or
               •      Position the Dogfight/Missile Override (DOGFIGHT) Switch to DGFT.
               This overrides any other master mode and configures the displays for air combat. The DOGFIGHT
               position provides symbology on the HUD for both 20mm gun firing and A-A missile delivery. The MSL
               position provides symbology on the HUD for A-A missile delivery only.

                   Available Stations
     The number and type of missiles is displayed next to OSB 7. The stations with missiles loaded are
     displayed at the bottom and the selected station is boxed. Step through available stations with the
     MSL Step button or by selecting the adjacent OSB.
     SPOT/SCAN commands the missile seeker to either scan in a narrow field of view (SPOT) or wide
     field of view (SCAN). The wider field of view is achieved by seeker nutation around the line of sight.
     Detection range is decreased when SCAN is used. SCAN mode is not currently implemented.
     SLAVE/BORE commands the missile to either follow the radar line of sight (SLAVE) or keep looking
     straight ahead down the boresight (BORE). Pressing and holding the CURSOR/ENABLE control
     overrides the current selected option. Releasing the control returns to the option selected on the
     MFD.
     WARM/COOL activates or deactivates argon cooling of the seeker. This should be set to COOL
     prior to an engagement to cool the seeker and increase detection sensitivity. COOL is selected
     automatically when entering DGFT or MSL Override mode. Argon supply duration varies depending
     on outside air temperature, pressure, and bottle charge level at installation, but the average duration
     is 90 minutes.
2.   Verify A-A Missile symbology is displayed in the HUD.
     The air-to-air HUD provides information on the status and targeting of air-to-air missiles. Most of the
     symbology from the NAV mode is retained but several new features are added to aid in target
     acquisition and missile launch.
     The Missile Diamond indicates the position of the AIM-9 seeker head. This starts at the seeker
     boresight position but unlatches to follow the radar line of sight or track a locked target when a lock is
     achieved.
     The Missile Reticle shows the seeker field of view. This will be shown as different sizes depending
     on the SPOT/SCAN field of view setting chosen on the MFD.



                                                                                 Missile Diamond

3.   Acquire target using radar (optional).
     Perhaps the most common and easiest way to target an aircraft with the AIM-9 is to acquire a target
     with one of the ACM Radar Modes. This slews the AIM-9 seeker to the radar target if SLAVE is
            selected on the missile. This results in an AIM-9 lock if the target is in range and other IR detection
            conditions are met.
     4.     Maneuver until target is in launch zone.
            Fly the missile reticle in the HUD over a target. If the missile detects enough IR energy from the
            target, target detection is indicated by an audio missile detection tone (growling sound).
     5.     Press Uncage switch to command missile self-track.
            When the AIM-9 seeker detects a target, it can be uncaged by pressing the Cage/Uncage button to
            allow the seeker lock on and follow the target within the confines of the missile seeker’s field of view.
            The Missile Diamond latches to the target when locked.
     6.     Verify missile diamond is on target and lock tone is audible.
            The missile growl will become high pitched when the target is locked. A Target Designator Box will
            be present over a target locked with radar. If firing against a radar target, the Missile Diamond
            should be over the Target Designator box. The Target Range is displayed if radar is used.




                                                                                          Dynamic Launch Zone

The Dynamic Launch Zone (DLZ) will be displayed on the right side of the HUD when a target is designated
with the radar. Monitor the DLZ and assess the threat situation to determine the optimal missile firing point. The
missile diamond flashes when the target is within maximum aerodynamic range (Raero). The missile reticle
flashes when the target is within maximum maneuvering range (Rtr, when the missile would be effective against
even a target that immediately turns and runs).

    7.   Press the Weapon Release switch to fire the missile.
         The missile will attempt to intercept the target and the next missile in sequence will be selected. The
         AIM-9 is a fire and forget weapon so there is no need to continue tracking the target.


AIM-9M/X HMCS Missile BORE Employment
The HMCS allows the AIM-9M or AIM-9X missiles to slave to the Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) Aiming Cross
when BORE mode is selected on the missile. This is useful in situations where no radar lock is possible or
desired. This can be thought of as normal AIM-9 employment, except the HMD line of sight is used instead of
the HUD line of sight. The mechanization is otherwise the same.
    1.   Turn on the Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) symbology.
         Power to the HMCS is selected from the HMD Symbology control knob on the left auxiliary console.
         Rotating the knob clockwise from the OFF position to INC (increase) provides power to the HMD.
         Continued clockwise rotation increases symbology brightness.




    2.   Select AIM-9s on the MFD by pressing OSB 7 until AIM-9s are displayed, or
         position the Dogfight/Missile Override (DOGFIGHT) Switch to DGFT.
         Symbology and functions are identical to non-HMCS employment. Set the Line-of-Sight mode to
         BORE to use the HMCS for AIM-9M/X targeting without radar.

3.   Acquire the target in the HMD.
     With the AIM-9 set to BORE and the HMCS on, the seeker will follow the Dynamic Aiming Cross in
     the HMD display. The aiming cross is treated as the boresight position. Simply look at the target
     instead of flying the aircraft all the way into position for an AIM-9 lock.
     Remember, you will still be constrained by the missile seeker gimbal limits when looking around. The
     Missile Diamond shows where the missile seeker is looking. If you look beyond the missile seeker
     gimbal limits, the diamond symbol will be displayed with an “X” through it and will be clamped to the
     edge of the HMCS display area.
     The other symbology on the display intentionally mimics the symbology from the HUD.

    5.   Verify missile diamond is on target and lock tone is audible.
         The missile growl will become high pitched when the target is locked. The Missile Diamond should
         be latched to the target and no longer follow the Aiming Cross.
    6.   Press the Weapon Release switch to fire the missile.
         The missile will track the target and the next missile in sequence will be selected. The AIM-9 is a fire
         and forget weapon so there is no need to continue tracking the target.


AIM-9M/X HMCS Radar BORE Employment
The HMCS also allows the Fire Control Radar to slave to the HMCS Aiming Cross when ACM BORE radar
mode is selected. This can be thought of as normal AIM-9 employment, except the HMD line of sight is used
instead of the HUD line of sight. The mechanization is otherwise the same.

     forward once, then simply look at the target instead of flying the aircraft all the way into position for a
     radar lock.
     Remember, you will still be constrained by the radar gimbal limits when looking around. The ACM
     BORE Symbol shows where the radar is pointing. If you look too far off the aircraft boresight, the

4.   Achieve radar lock in ACM BORE Mode.
     The radar will lock the first target detected within the ACM Bore Symbol. A Target Designator Box
     will be present over a target locked with radar.
     With the AIM-9 line of sight set to SLAVE, the seeker will slew to the radar line of sight. When the
     AIM-9 seeker detects a target, it can be uncaged by pressing the Cage/Uncage button. This allows
     the seeker to lock on and follow the target within the confines of the missile seeker’s gimbal limits.
     The Missile Diamond latches to the target when the seeker has locked on.

     The Dynamic Launch Zone (DLZ) will be displayed on the right side of the HMD when a target is
     designated with the radar. Monitor the DLZ and assess the threat situation to determine the optimal
     missile firing point. The missile diamond flashes when target is within maximum range against a
     maneuvering target.

5.   Verify missile diamond is on target and lock tone is audible.
     The missile growl will become high pitched when the target is locked. The Missile Diamond should
     be latched to the target.
6.   Press the Weapon Release switch to fire the missile.
     The missile will attempt to intercept the target and the next missile in sequence will be selected. The
     AIM-9 is a fire and forget weapon so there is no need to continue tracking the target.
AIM-120 AMRAAM
The AIM-120 AMRAAM is an Active Radar-Homing (ARH) air-to-air missile that can self-guide to a target using
an active radar seeker in its nose. The missile is guided initially via datalink commands from the launching
aircraft, and transitions to onboard active radar homing once within range. Because of the active seeker, the
pilot can engage multiple targets at once without needing to support the missile for its entire time of flight.
The AIM-120 is a medium range missile and can engage targets outside 20 nm. However, engagement range is
highly dependent on target aspect, engagement altitude, launch speed, and target post-launch maneuvering. As
such, the engagement range of the AIM-120 can be less than 10 nm in some situations.
In WVR combat, the AIM-120 can also be launched in BORE mode without a radar lock. Once the missile is
launched, it will track and attempt to hit the first target it detects within the AIM-120 reticle on the HUD.


SMS Format
With AIM-120s selected, the SMS format appears as shown:




              Operating Mode


                                                                                          Selected Weapon


                  Line of Sight




             Available Stations




Line of Sight. When set to SLAVE, missile radar line of sight is slaved to the aircraft’s radar. The missile will
receive datalink steering from the launching aircraft until it’s within radar range, then it will attempt to track the
target. When set to BORE, the missile’s radar scans straight ahead. It will track the first detected target after
launch. Pressing Cursor Enable also cycles between SLAVE and BORE modes.

Master Arm Status. Displays “ARM” when Master Arm is on.
Missiles Remaining. Displays the number of missiles remaining and “MRM” for medium-range missile.
Missile Diamond. Indicates missile radar line of sight. This is initialized at seeker boresight position but will
slew to target LOS when SLAVE mode is selected, and a target is locked.
Allowable Steering Error Circle (ASEC). Indicates the zone in which the Attack Steering Cue (ASC) should
be located prior to launch to hit the target with a high probability kill (PK). The ASC is displayed after radar lock.
The ASEC shows the maximum angular steering error probability. In other words, the circle increases in size
when the distance to the target intercept point decreases, which means that as the distance decreases, the
missile can be launched with greater steering error.

Range Scale. Indicates the range represented by the highest tick mark.
RAERO (aerodynamic range). The maximum kinematic range of the missile. A shot at this distance would only be
effective against a target that continues its current course and speed and does not maneuver.
Closure Rate and Range. The caret indicates the current target range against the DLZ, and the adjacent
number is the closure rate in knots.
RTR (turn-and-run range). The maximum range where the missile is guaranteed to reach the target regardless of
target maneuvering. A shot at this distance would hit a target that immediately turns 180° away from the missile
while maintaining speed.
Radar Activation Range. The range at which the missile will activate its own radar, and no longer needs
continued support from the launching aircraft.
RMIN (minimum range). The closest range that allows the missile to activate its seeker, lock a target, arm, and
detonate safely.
Countdown Timer. Displayed after missile launch. Displays “A” followed by the number of seconds until the
missile activates its seeker, then “T” followed by the number of seconds until predicted impact.


FCR Post-Launch Symbology
Following AIM-120 launch, the FCR format will display different symbols to indicate different missile
employment statuses:


                    A target with an AMRAAM in flight is displayed in magenta with a solid “tail” opposite its trend
                    vector.




                    A target with at least one AMRAAM in flight that has gone active is displayed in red, and the tail
                    flashes.




                    A target with at least one AMRAAM that has reached predicted time of impact is displayed with
                    a flashing “X” through it.




AIM-120 Employment
  Summary
          1.     Select A/A master mode [1] or MSL override mode [4]
          2.     Set Master Arm Switch to Arm
          3.     Acquire target using radar (optional but recommended)
          4.     Maneuver until target is in launch zone
          5.     Depress Weapon Release [RAlt]+[Space] switch to fire missile

     1.        There are two ways to select the AIM-120 for employment:
                •    Select AIM-120s on the MFD by pressing OSB 7 until AIM-120s are displayed, or
                •    Position the Dogfight/Missile Override Switch to MSL OVRD. This overrides any other master
                     mode and configures the displays for air combat. The MSL position provides symbology on the
                     HUD for A-A missile delivery and selects the longest-range missile type loaded.
2.   Verify A-A Missile symbology is displayed in the HUD.
     The air-to-air HUD provides information on the status and targeting of air-to-air missiles. Most of the
     symbology from the NAV mode is retained but several new features are added to aid in target
     acquisition and missile launch.
3.   Acquire target using the radar
     Typically, a target will be locked using RWS, TWS, or any ACM radar sub-mode and the AIM-120 set
     to SLAVE.
     When the locked target is outside the HUD field on view as shown below, a Target Locator Line
     (TLL) extends from the Gun Cross and points directly at the target. The Relative Angle is displayed
     next to the Gun Cross showing the angle in degrees between the cross and the target.
     The Allowable Steering Error Circle (ASEC) changes size and the Attack Steering Cue (ASC)
     becomes visible. The Target Range is displayed after target radar lock.
4.   Maneuver until Attack Steering Cue (ASC) is inside the Allowable Steering Error Circle (ASEC)
     The size of the Allowable Steering Error Circle will vary depending on the target range and aspect.
     Ensure that the Attack Steering Cue is located as close to the Allowable Steering Error Circle
     center as possible when firing to achieve the best performance out of the missile.
     When the target enters the HUD, the Target Designator Box will be displayed over the target and
     the Missile Diamond will track that location.

     Monitor the Dynamic Launch Zone and assess the threat situation to determine the optimal missile
     firing point.
5.   Press and hold the Weapon Release switch to fire the missile.
     The missile will track the target and the next missile in sequence will be selected.
     The AIM-120 may also be employed in BORE mode without a radar lock on the target. This is used
     when a quick shot must be taken, or no radar emissions are desired. The missile radar will go active
     at launch and guide on the first target it detects so use this mode with care.
Simultaneous Employment Against Multiple Targets
The F-16 FCR can support up to four simultaneous in-flight AMRAAMS against up to four targets. Simultaneous
employment is accomplished in TWS or RWS DTT mode.

  Summary
         1.     Select A/A master mode [1] or MSL override mode [4]
         2.     Set Master Arm Switch to Arm
         3.     Acquire at least two targets using TWS or DTT
         4.     Maneuver until all targets are in launch zone
         5.     Depress Weapon Release [RAlt]+[Space] to fire first missile
         6.     Press TMS Left to cycle bug to next target
         7.     Depress Weapon Release [RAlt]+[Space] to fire second missile
         8.


    1.        Select AIM-120s for employment:
                   a.   Activate A-A master mode using the ICP, then on the SMS format, press OSB6 until AIM-
                        120 is selected; or
                   b.   Place the Dogfight/Missile Override switch in MSL OVRD.
    2.        Set the Master Arm switch to Arm.
    3.        Acquire at least two targets using TWS or DTT.
              In RWS mode, move the acquisition cursor over the first target and press TMS Forward to designate
              it. Then, move the acquisition cursor over the second target and press TMS Forward to designate it.
              In TWS mode, move the acquisition cursor over each target and press TMS Forward to designate it
              as a System Target. You may designate up to four System Targets for AMRAAM employment.




                                                                                        Bugged Target


                                                                                       System Target
4.   Maneuver until all targets are within the launch zone. DLZ information is only displayed for the
     current bugged target. Use TMS left to cycle between bugged targets and track DLZ status for each.
5.   Depress Weapons Release to fire first missile, then press TMS Left to cycle the bug to the next
     target, and press Weapons Release again to fire the second missile. If using TWS, you can repeat
     this process up to four times total.
AIR-TO-GROUND
 EMPLOYMENT
ATTACK PREPARATION
Prior to reaching the target area and conducting your attack, you will want to configure several aircraft systems
ahead of time so that you can most efficiently communicate and set up your attack. When at a minimum of 40
nm from the target, you will want to take the following steps:
     1.   Position the Master Arm Switch to ARM. Weapons may be released normally when in the ARM
          position. If the Master Arm switch is placed in the SAFE position, weapon release is inhibited.
     2.   Position the Laser Arm Switch to ARM. This is required to enable firing of the laser designator. Laser
          firing is inhibited with the switch set to OFF.




     3.   Place the fire control system in A-G mode by pressing the A-G Master Mode Button on the ICP.
M6A1 20MM CANNON STRAFE
The M61A1 20MM automatic gun system provides the pilot with a formidable weapon capability. It is a six-barrel
Gatling type gun mounted in the left strake of the aircraft. The system has a capacity of 512 rounds of
ammunition fired at 6,000 rounds per minute.

  Summary
          1.     Select A-G Master Mode [2]
          2.     Set Master Arm Switch to Arm
          3.     Set Laser Arm Switch to Arm if laser ranging updates are desired
          4.     Select STRF sub-mode on SMS MFD
          5.     Fly the Pipper onto the target
          6.     Squeeze the Trigger [Space] to the second detent to fire the gun



Target Attack
Upon selection of the A-G master mode, the SMS Air-to-Ground (SMS A-G) page is displayed on the right MFD.
Based on the priority weapon, the information on the SMS A-G page can vary. Follow these steps to achieve
the correct configuration and attack ground targets with the gun:
     1.        Select the STRF sub-mode on the MFD by pressing OSB 1 until GUN is displayed.




                  Operating Mode                                                            Gun Status

                                                                                            Rounds Remaining




                                                                                            In-Range Cue Distance




                                                                                            System Status




     2.        Verify STRF symbology is displayed in the HUD.
               The Strafe Reticle is the default air to ground gunsight and provides aiming information required to
               fire the gun effectively. The center of the reticle is the aiming pipper and represents where the gun
               rounds will go assuming the target is within range. Using the pipper, it is simply a case of “putting the
               thing on the thing” and pulling the trigger.
               Line of sight range is indicated by the digital range numeric on the bottom right of the HUD and the
               ranging reticle that winds or unwinds within the reticle. The position of the ranging reticle indicates the
     slant range to the pipper’s position on the ground. Each quarter circle tick on the strafe reticle
     represents 3,000 feet of slant range, so:
          •      12 o’clock = 12,000 ft
          •      9 o’clock = 9,000 ft
          •      6 o’clock = 6,000 ft
          •      3 o’clock = 3,000 ft
     The in-range cue position may be set by the pilot provide an additional visual cue for the effective
     range against the planned target.

3.   Maneuver your aircraft to position the pipper on target.
     One technique is to place the pipper short of the target and allow it to track along the ground until it
     reaches the target. This will happen naturally as slant range decreases.




     Laser ranging may be performed to improve the computed firing solution if a targeting pod is installed.
     See the Laser Ranging section for more information.
4.   Squeeze the trigger all the way to the second detent to fire the gun when the pipper is over the
     target and you are within effective range.
     In this example, the pipper is on-target at a slant range of about 5,500 feet as shown by the position
     on the ranging reticle.
          Slant range greatly affects gun effectiveness. As the rounds come out of the gun, they will gradually
          disperse and lose velocity. Increased dispersion and loss of velocity reduce the accuracy and
          effectiveness of the gun. Effective engagement range is generally from 2,500 to 7,000 feet. For
          armored vehicles, closer is better, and you should attack from behind the target where its armor is
          weakest.
          When lining up a shot, be careful to avoid target fixation. Target fixation can lead to you not noticing
          an unseen threat or pressing the attack too close. Don’t make yourself an easy target for the machine
          gun on the top of that APC!
Once you have reached the minimum attack range, break off in both the horizontal and vertical to avoid hostile
return fire. You may also wish to release flares in case an infrared-SAM near the enemy target has been
launched at you, but you did not see it.


In-Range Cue Update
The position of the In-Range Cue on the reticle may be updated by selecting the OSB next to the In-Range Cue
distance on the SMS page.




                                                                                     In-Range Cue Distance
Type in the new in-range cue distance using the OSBs on the left and right of the display and select ENTR. You
may correct numbers entered in error by selecting RCL or return to the SMS page without making changes by
selecting RTN.




                                                                                     In-Range Cue Distance




You will be returned to the SMS page and the new value will be displayed. The cue will be placed on the HUD
Strafe Reticle at that new distance.




                                                                 In-Range Cue Distance
2.75-INCH ROCKETS
Aerial rockets pack more punch than the 20mm gun but are still best used as an area suppression weapon.
These come with different warhead options for different purposes including High Explosive (HE), High Explosive
Anti-Tank (HEAT), and Armor Piercing (AP). White Phosphorus (WP) rounds may also be used for incendiary
effect or to mark targets on the ground with their distinctive white smoke.

Target Attack (CCIP)
Upon selection of the A-G master mode, the SMS Air-to-Ground (SMS A-G) page is displayed on the right MFD.
Based on the priority weapon, the information on the SMS A-G page can vary. Follow these steps to achieve
the correct configuration and attack ground targets with rockets in CCIP mode:
     1.        Select the Rockets on the MFD by pressing OSB 6 until rockets are displayed.




                                                                                        Rocket Status
                  Operating Mode

                        Sub-mode



                                                                                        Rockets Remaining
                                                                                        and Type


                                                                                        Single/Pair Option




                                                                                        System Status




     2.        Verify CCIP release mode is selected (OSB 2) and set desired Single/Pair option (OSB 8).
               Rockets may be fired with either Single (SGL) or Pair (PAIR) selected. With SGL selected, rockets
               will be fired from only one launcher. With PAIR selected, rockets will be fired from each rocket
               launcher, assuming launchers are loaded on station 3 and 7.
              Sub-mode
                                                                                Rockets Remaining
                                                                                and Type




                                                                                Single/Pair Option




3.   Verify CCIP Rockets symbology is displayed in the HUD.
     CCIP mode is perhaps the most intuitive means to put a weapon on target and mostly involves
     placing the “death dot” of the CCIP pipper over the target and releasing the weapon… put the thing
     on the thing.
     The center of the CCIP pipper represents where the rockets will go assuming the target is within
     range. Line of sight range is indicated by the digital range numeric on the bottom right of the HUD. An
     In-Range Cue will be displayed over the CCIP pipper when slant range is less than 8,000 feet and
     rockets are most effective.

                                                                              CCIP Pipper

                                                                               Slant Range
      CCIP Sub-mode




4.   Maneuver your aircraft to position the CCIP pipper on target.
          One technique is to place the pipper just short of the target and allow it to track along the ground until
          it reaches the target. This will happen naturally as slant range decreases. Monitor slant range
          displayed in the bottom right of the HUD and watch for the in-range cue to appear over the pipper.




          Laser ranging may be performed to improve the computed firing solution if a targeting pod is installed.
          See the Laser Ranging section for more information.
     5.   Press the Weapon Release button to fire the rockets when the CCIP pipper is over the target
          and you are within effective range.
          The In-Range Cue is a line over the CCIP pipper that is displayed when slant range is less than 8,000
          feet. In this example, the pipper is on-target and the in-range cue is displayed.




                                                                                In-Range Cue




          When lining up a shot, be careful to avoid target fixation. Target fixation can lead to you not noticing
          an unseen threat or pressing the attack too close. Don’t make yourself an easy target for the machine
          gun on the top of that APC!
Once you have reached the minimum attack range, break off in both the horizontal and vertical to avoid hostile
return fire. You may also wish to release flares in case an infrared-SAM near the enemy target has been
launched at you, but you did not see it.
UNGUIDED BOMBS
Unguided bombs that the F-16C can employ fall into three categories: General Purpose (GP), Cluster, and
Training.


General Purpose Bombs
MK 82 LDGP. The standard MK 82 is a low drag “slick” bomb, also referred to as a Low Drag General Purpose
(LDGP) bomb. The bomb is aerodynamically streamlined with four conical tail fins for flight stability. The bomb
has a thin steel jacket that contributes to fragmentation effects.
The MK 82 may be carried singly on a Wing Weapons Pylon (WWP) or three may be loaded on a Triple Ejector
Rack (TER)
The MK 82 serves as the basis for several other bombs including the MK 82AIR, GBU-12, and GBU-38.
MK 82 AIR. This version of the MK 82 adds the BSU-49/B high drag tail assembly, also called a “ballute”. This
allows the bomb to rapidly slow down after release. By slowing down, you can release such a retarded weapon
at low altitude and not be caught in the blast effect of the weapon. You can choose to release the MK 82AIR in
either retarded or “slick” (no ballute deployed) modes. To drop as a slick, select only a nose fuze, and to release
retarded, select nose/tail or tail fuze setting on the SMS page.
MK 82 SE. This ‘Snake Eye” version of the MK 82 pre-dates the MK 82 AIR and uses fins that deploy from the
Mk-15 tail assembly to slow the bomb’s fall. You can choose to release the MK 82 SE in either retarded or
“slick” modes. To drop as a slick, select only a nose fuze, and to release retarded, select nose/tail or tail fuze
setting on the SMS page.
MK 84 LDGP. The MK 84 is the big brother of the MK 82 and it weighs 2,039 lbs. with 945 lbs. of H-6 or Tritonal
high explosive. Although most effective against unarmored and lightly armored targets, the MK 84 can also be
effective against armored targets when dropped in proximity. The MK 84 can only be mounted on a WWP and
cannot be loaded on a TER.
The MK 84 forms the basis for other bombs including the GBU-10 and GBU-31 that the F-16C also carries.


Cluster Bombs
CBU-87. The CBU-87 Combined Effects Munitions (CEM) weighs 950 lbs. and is an all-purpose cluster bomb.
The SUU-65 Tactical Munitions Dispenser that makes the body of the bomb contains 202 BLU-97/B Combined
Effects Munitions (CEM) bomblets and they are effective against lightly armored and unarmored targets. The
dispersal footprint of the bomblets depends on the Height of Function (HOF) and RPM spin setting set with dials
on the bomb and displayed on the SMS page. However, the general bomblet footprint coverage is 200 by 400
meters.
The CBU-87 can be mounted singly on a WWP. Only two may be loaded on a TER when wing external fuel
tanks are installed due to clearance constraints. This is commonly referred to as a ‘slant load’.
Each BLU-97/B CEB consists of a shaped charge, a scored steel casing, and a zirconium ring, for anti-armor
and anti-personnel fragmentation and incendiary effects. Each CEB is designed to fragment into 300 fragments.
Given the top attack angle of the weapon, the CEB can be effective against the generally light armor covering
the top of an armored vehicle such as a tank.
CBU-97. The CBU-97 is a 1,000-pound class weapon containing sensor-fused sub-munitions in a SUU-66B
Dispenser for specifically attacking armor. This Sensor Fused Weapon (SFW) contains 10 BLU-108/B sub-
munitions, and 40 “hockey puck” shaped skeet infrared sensing projectiles.
As with the CBU-87, the dispersal footprint of the bomblets depends on the Height of Function (HOF) set with
dials on the bomb and displayed on the SMS page. The RPM is not applicable on this dispenser. The same
carriage restrictions as the CBU-87 apply: one per WWP and two per TER.


Training Bombs
BDU-33. The BDU-33 is a miniaturized training bomb that mimics the ballistics of larger general-purpose
bombs. The BDU-33 contains a small smoke charge to help round spotting.


Unguided/Laser Guided Bombs SMS Page
The A-G SMS display and procedure for setting up an attack with guided or unguided bombs is very similar for
all types. The initial set-up will only be covered once, with differences in CCIP, CCRP sub-modes covered in
separate sections below.

  Summary
          1.     Select A-G Master Mode [2]
          2.     Select bombs and set desired options on SMS A-G MFD

Upon selection of the A-G master mode, the SMS Air-to-Ground (SMS A-G) page is displayed on the right MFD.
Based on the priority weapon, the information on the SMS A-G page can vary. Follow these steps to achieve
the correct configuration and attack ground targets with GP bombs in CCIP mode:
     1.        Select the desired weapons on the MFD by pressing OSB 6 until the weapons you want to
               release are displayed.



                                                                                         Weapon Status

                                                                                         and Type
                        Sub-mode


                                                                                         Selected Profile

                                                                                         Single / Pair Option
                                                                                         and Release Pulses
                    Fuzing Option
                                                                                         Release Interval Distance


                                                                                         Release Pulses Requested




                                                                                         System Status




     2.        Select the desired profile for the selected weapons.
               Two different profiles are pre-set by default. These include typical settings for delivery mode, fuze
               arming option, bomb impact spacing, and release quantity. If a profile already matches your planned
     attack profile, you are all set; no more changes are required! If not, follow the steps that follow in this
     section to set the profile up to your liking.
     Selecting the OSB next to the current profile to cycle between the two options: PROF1 and PROF2.




                                                                                   Selected Profile




     Changes to settings made while a profile is selected are saved for later use. These should typically
     be set or verified as part of aircraft startup, although they may be changed at any time.
3.   Select your desired release sub-mode. (OSB 2)
     If a sub-mode other than the one you want is selected, you may press OSB 2 to display the following
     options:
          •    CCIP – Continuously Computed Impact Point
          •    CCRP – Continuously Computed Release Point
          •    DTOS – Dive Toss
          •    LADD – Low Altitude Drogue Delivery
          •    MAN – Manual
     Then, select the OSB next to your desired sub-mode. That will set the new active sub-mode and
     return you to the SMS A-G page.
     Sub-mode Options




     You may also cycle between sub-modes by pressing the Missile Step (MSL STEP) button on your
     stick.
4.   Set desired bomb fuzing option. (OSB 18)
     Bombs are typically equipped with two fuzes, one in the nose and one in the tail. These are
     sometimes set with different impact delay settings to provide the pilot with the choice of how the fuze
     functions and when the bomb detonates after impact. Sometimes an instantaneous detonation is
     desired for fragmentation effects and sometimes a delayed detonation is desired to allow target
     penetration or cratering.
     Selecting OSB 18 cycles between three fuze arming options: NOSE, TAIL and NSTL (Nose/Tail).
     This is typically set to NSTL (Nose/Tail) for redundancy unless a specific effect is desired when the
     weapon detonates.
              Fuzing Option




     There are also some special cases where the fuze option changes how the weapon behaves after
     release:
          •    MK 82 AIR/SE
                   o    NSTL – High Drag
                   o    NOSE – Low Drag
                   o    TAIL – High Drag
          •    CBU-87/97
                   o    NSTL – Bomblets dispense using settings displayed on SMS page
                   o    NOSE – Bomblets dispense immediately after release
                   o    TAIL – Dud
5.   Set desired Single/Pair option. (OSB 8)
     Bombs may be released with either Single (SGL) or Pair (PAIR) selected. With SGL selected, bombs
     will be released from only one station. With PAIR selected, bombs will be released from both opposite
     stations, assuming identical bombs are loaded on stations 4 and 6 or 3 and 7.
                                                                              Single/Pair Option




6.   Set the desired release interval distance if more than one bomb is to be released. (OSB 9)
     The timing between release pulses is computed by the aircraft to space multiple weapons in a ‘stick’
     along the ground at the specified distance. Valid distances range from 10-999 feet. This setting has
     no effect if only one bomb or one pair of bombs is released.




                                                                              Interval Distance




     Type in the new impact spacing distance using the OSBs on the left and right of the display and
     select ENTR. You may correct numbers entered in error by selecting RCL or return to the SMS page
     without making changes by selecting RTN.
                                                                              Impact Spacing Distance




7.   Set the number of release pulses if more than one bomb is to be released. (OSB 10)
     This sets the number of release pulses sent to the weapons stations when the Weapon Release
     button is pressed. For example, a setting of 1 releases only one bomb or pair of bombs at a time
     while a setting of 4 releases four bombs or pairs of bombs at a time. This is commonly known as a
     ‘ripple release’.




                                                                              Release Pulses




     Type in the desired number of release pulses using the OSBs on the left and right of the display and
     select ENTR. You may correct numbers entered in error by selecting RCL or return to the SMS page
     without making changes by selecting RTN.
                                                                                         Release Pulses




Unguided Bombs CCIP Attack
The Continuously Computed Impact Point (CCIP) mode is a computed visual delivery mode with manual
weapon release. This mode allows a high degree of flexibility since the point on the ground at which the weapon
will impact is continuously indicated by a CCIP Pipper on the HUD. No target designation is required. Place the
thing on the thing and drop the bomb.

  Summary
          1.     Select A-G Master Mode [2]
          2.     Set Master Arm Switch to Arm
          3.     Set Laser Arm Switch to Arm if laser ranging updates are desired
          4.     Select Bombs and desired options on SMS MFD
          5.     Fly the Pipper onto the target
          6.     Depress the Weapons Release button [RAlt]+[Space] to expend weapons

     1.        Verify CCIP symbology is displayed in the HUD.
               If the CCIP impact point does not lay within the HUD field of view, the Time Delay Cue (TDC) is
               shown as a short, horizonal line on the Bomb Fall Line. The CCIP Pipper is outside the HUD field of
               view when this is displayed. A second, ‘post-designate CCIP’ technique may be used in this situation
               but that will be covered in the next section.
                                                                                Flight Path Marker




                                                                                Bomb Fall Line
                                                                                Marker

         Time Delay Cue
                                                                                Pull-Up Anticipation Cue

       Master Arm Status

      CCIP Sub-mode                                                             Slant Range



            CCIP Pipper




2.   Maneuver your aircraft to position the CCIP Pipper on target.
     When the TDC is no longer displayed on the Bomb Fall Line, the pipper is in the HUD field of view.
     That will be the impact point if the bombs are released immediately.
     One technique is to place the FPM ahead of the target and the pipper just short of the target. Fly the
     Bomb Fall Line over the target and allow the pipper to track straight up the line. This will happen
     naturally as slant range decreases.




                                                                                  Flight Path Marker


                                                                                 Pull-Up Anticipation Cue


                                                                                  Bomb Fall Line


                 Target




                                                                                  CCIP Pipper
                                                                                  Marker




     Monitor the Pull-Up Anticipation Cue to ensure it does not go above the Flight Path Marker. The Pull-
     Up Anticipation Cue (PUAC) provides a visual representation of the altitude required for the bomb
     fuze to arm or altitude to initiate a pull-up to avoid impacting the ground, whichever is more
          immediate. It moves up toward the Flight Path Marker (FPM) as the aircraft loses altitude. Releasing
          a bomb with the FPM below the PUAC will not give the bomb time to arm and result in a dud.
          Laser ranging may be performed to improve the computed firing solution if a targeting pod is installed.
          See the Laser Ranging section for more information.
     3.   Press the Weapon Release button to release the bombs when the CCIP pipper is over the
          target.
          The pipper will be at the center of the ‘stick’ if more than one bomb is released in a ripple delivery.
          Hold the Weapons Release button long enough to ensure all weapons come off. The FPM flashes
          after weapons are released.

          Pull up immediately and take evasive action to avoid flying into bomb fragments and to avoid enemy
          fire.


Unguided Bombs CCIP Attack (Post-Designate)
An additional option for CCIP bombs delivery is available for situations where the target cannot be within the
HUD field of view at release. This can sometimes happen on attacks from a shallow dive angle or high altitude.
The steps to enter CCIP mode are the same as described above. The difference is in when you press and hold
the Weapons Release button.
     1.   Maneuver your aircraft to position the CCIP Pipper on target.
          When the Time Delay Cue is displayed on the Bomb Fall Line, the pipper is not in the HUD field of
          view, however you will still place the pipper over the intended target.
          You will designate that location as the target by pressing and holding the Weapons Release button.
          The fire control computer will do the rest.

     Laser ranging may be performed to improve the computed firing solution if a targeting pod is installed.
     See the Laser Ranging section for more information.
2.   Press and HOLD the Weapons Release button.
     The HUD symbology displayed is identical to that used for a CCRP delivery. Keep the Flight Path
     Marker aligned with the Steering Line. This will align your aircraft with the target even though the
     target will be out of sight.
     A Solution Cue is displayed at the top of the Steering Line. It will fall down the line as the range
     decreases and the weapon is about to be released.

               Hold the Weapons Release button long enough to ensure all weapons come off. The FPM flashes
               after weapons are released. Pull up immediately and take evasive action to avoid flying into bomb
               fragments and to avoid enemy fire.


Unguided Bombs CCRP Attack
The Continuously Computed Release Point (CCRP) mode provides computed, automatic release of bombs.
This can be done from a dive, but also from wings-level or a nose-high attitude.
This mode requires a target designation point from which to build the bombing solution. Command steering is
provided to the appropriate weapon release point and the weapon will release automatically at the proper time
such that the weapons hit the target.

               A Solution Cue is displayed at the top of the SL. It will fall down the line as the range decreases and
               the weapons are about to be released.
     When the Target Designator (TD) is outside the HUD field on view as shown above, a Target Locator
     Line (TLL) extends from the Gun Cross pointing directly at the target. The relative angle is displayed
     next to the Gun Cross showing the number of degrees in tens between the cross and the target.
2.   Designate the desired target.
     To calculate a bombing solution in CCRP mode, a target first must be designated. This can be done
     by:
          •       Selecting a Steerpoint that was placed at the target location
          •       Designating a target with the Targeting Pod (if installed)
     Updates to the target location may be made by slewing the TD Box in the HUD or slewing the TGP
     cursor onto a new position with the Cursor/Enable Control.

     Monitor the Pull-Up Anticipation Cue to ensure it does not go above the Flight Path Marker. The Pull-
     Up Anticipation Cue (PUAC) provides a visual representation of the altitude required for the bomb
     fuze to arm or altitude to initiate a pull-up to avoid impacting the ground, whichever is more
     immediate. It moves up toward the Flight Path Marker (FPM) as the aircraft loses altitude. Releasing
     a bomb with the FPM below the PUAC will not give the bomb time to arm and result in a dud.
     Laser ranging may be performed to improve the computed firing solution if a targeting pod is installed.
     See the Laser Ranging section for more information.
3.   Press and HOLD the Weapon Release button.
     Keep the Flight Path Marker aligned with the Steering Line. This will align your aircraft with the target
     even though the target will be out of sight.
     Time to release counts down at the lower right of the HUD.

     When the Solution Cue begins to move down the Steering Line, about 10 seconds prior to release,
     press and hold the Weapon Release button. This provides the fire control computer consent to
     release the weapons.
4.   Keep the Weapons Release button held until after the Solution Cue passes the Flight Path
     Marker.
     Keep flying the Flight Path Marker over the Steering Line as the Sulution Cue continues to track
     downward. The bombs are released when the Steering Cue passes the Flight Path Marker.

     Hold the Weapons Release button long enough to ensure all weapons come off. The FPM flashes
     after weapons are released.
LASER-GUIDED BOMBS
The development of laser guided weapons has dramatically improved the accuracy of weapon guidance and
delivery. With the assistance of build-up guidance kits, general GP bombs are turned into laser-guided bombs
(LGBs). The kits consist of a computer- control group (CCG), guidance canards attached to the front of the
warhead to provide steering commands, and a wing assembly attached to the aft end to provide lift. LGBs are
maneuverable, free-fall weapons requiring no electronic interconnect to the aircraft. They have an internal semi-
active guidance system that detects laser energy and guides the weapon to a target illuminated by an external
laser source. The designator can be in the delivery aircraft, another aircraft, or a ground source.
All LGB weapons have a Computer Control Group (CCG), a warhead (bomb body with fuze), and an airfoil
group. The computer section transmits directional command signals to the appropriate pair of canards. The
guidance canards are attached to each quadrant of the control unit to change the flight path of the weapon. The
canard deflections are always full scale (referred to as “bang, bang” guidance).
The LGB flight path is divided into three phases: ballistic, transition, and terminal guidance. During the ballistic
phase, the weapon continues via the unguided trajectory established by the flight path of the delivery aircraft at
the moment of release. In the ballistic phase, the delivery attitude takes on additional importance since
maneuverability of the LGB is related to the weapon velocity during terminal guidance. Therefore, airspeed lost
during the ballistic phase equates to a proportional loss of maneuverability. The transition phase begins at
acquisition. During the transition phase, the weapon attempts to align its velocity vector with the line-of-sight
vector to the target. During terminal guidance, the LGB attempts to keep its velocity vector aligned with the
instantaneous line-of-sight. At the instant alignment occurs, the reflected laser energy centers on the detector
and commands the canards to a trail position, which causes the weapon to fly ballistically with gravity biasing
towards the target.
GBU-10 Paveway II. This Guided Bomb Unit (GBU) weighs 2,562 lbs. and is basically a laser-guided version of
the Mk-84 unguided bomb with a general-purpose warhead. The laser detector on the nose of the seeker
detects the reflected energy of the designating laser at the set laser code. Once dropped, the wing-like airfoil
surfaces at the rear of the bomb extend and are used to maneuver the bomb to the laser designation point.
Rather than smooth and constant input of course-corrections to reach the target, the bomb uses a series of
discreet input corrections and this is often referred to as “bang-bang” guidance mode.
GBU-10 can only be hung from a MAU-12 ejector rack on stations 3, 4, 6, and 7.
Suitable targets for the GBU-10 are large and/or hardened targets that require an accurate and powerful strike.
Such targets often include bridges, bunkers, and hardened command posts.
GBU-12 Paveway II. This GBU is the laser-guided version of the Mk-82 unguided, general purpose bomb. The
GBU-12 guides using the same principles as the GBU-10, the only difference being the bomb the LGB is based
on.
The GBU-12 can be mounted singly on a MAU-12 ejector rack at stations 3, 4, 6, and 7. Only two may be
loaded on a TER when wing external fuel tanks are installed due to clearance constraints. This is commonly
referred to as a ‘slant load’.


Bomb Seeker Laser Code
The seeker head on each laser guided bomb is set to track only a specific laser pulse rate frequency (PRF)
code. These are manually set by the weapons load crew during ground operations and may not be set from the
cockpit during flight.
To replicate this, the laser code may be set using the mission editor. In this example, the laser code on each
bomb seeker head is 1564.
An additional method to set the bomb seeker laser code is included on the in-game kneeboard. You may
access this using keyboard command [RShift]+[K], then use the [ and ] (bracket) keys to access the page. Use
the keyboard commands listed to the right of each digit to change the laser code.
Bomb seeker laser codes can only be changed using this method on the ground prior to engine start and with
the STA POWER switch on the right console OFF.




The laser designator on the Targeting Pod must be set to match the code on the bomb. See the section on the
LASR DED Page for procedures.


SMS Page
The A-G SMS display and procedures for setting up an attack with guided or unguided bombs are identical. See
the section on the Bombs A-G SMS Page for procedures.
Laser Guided Bomb CCRP Attack
The Continuously Computed Release Point (CCRP) mode provides computed, automatic release of bombs.
This can be done from a dive, but also from wings-level or a nose-high attitude. The laser guided bomb attack is
identical to unguided bombs with the addition of laser designation with the Targeting Pod (TGP)
This mode requires a target designation point from which to build the bombing solution. Command steering is
provided to the appropriate weapon release point and the weapon will release automatically at the proper time
such that the weapons hit the target.
The bomb laser code must match the TGP laser designator laser code. See the sections on Bomb Seeker
Laser Code and Laser Designator Code for procedures.

               A Solution Cue is displayed at the top of the SL. It will fall down the line as the range decreases and
               the weapons are about to be released.
     When the Target Designator (TD) is outside the HUD field on view as shown above, a Target Locator
     Line (TLL) extends from the Gun Cross pointing directly at the target. The relative angle is displayed
     next to the Gun Cross showing the number of degrees in tens between the cross and the target.
2.   Verify TGP is configured for target search and laser fire.
     Select A-G mode on the TGP to configure it for target acquisition and weapon guidance. The line of
     sight will slave to the current steerpoint when CCRP delivery mode is selected.
     The TGP display may be made the sensor of interest (SOI) by positioning the Display Management
     Switch (DMS) Down. The current SOI can be identified by the box surrounding the display.

     The TGP crosshairs may then be slewed to a new position using the Cursor/Enable Control. Slewing
     the Target Designator with the HUD as SOI will also slew the TGP crosshairs.
3.   Locate and designate the desired target.
     To calculate a bombing solution in CCRP mode, a target first must be designated. This can be done
     in two ways:
          •      Select a Steerpoint that was placed at the target location. The Target Designator box
                 on the HUD will be placed at the steerpoint. The TGP will slave to that location when CCRP
                 mode is selected.
          •      Locate a target with the Targeting Pod. With the TGP SOI, position the TMS Down to
                 undesignate. The TGP will return to the boresight position near the center of the HUD. Fly
                 or slew the TGP line of sight to the desired target location. TMS Up to designate. The
                 Target Designator box on the HUD will be placed at that location.
     Updates to the target location may be made by slewing the TD Box in the HUD or slewing the TGP
     cursor onto a new position with the Cursor/Enable Control. The Targeting Pod line of sight is used to
     calculate the bombing solution regardless of the track mode used.
     Command an area track with TMS Up to stabilize the crosshairs over the target. A Point Track may
     also be commanded using TMS Up to aid in targeting if desired.
                                                                                   Situational Awareness Cue

     Laser ranging may be performed prior to weapon release to improve the computed firing solution.
     See the Laser Ranging section for more information.
     The laser designator may be fired with any sensor type selected and from any track mode. The Laser
     status is displayed as an L near the bottom of the display when the Laser Arm switch is set to arm.
     The laser is fired by squeezing the trigger to the first detent. The L flashes when the laser designator
     is firing.
4.   Execute a CCRP bombing delivery.
     Weapons delivery for laser guided bombs is identical to unguided bomb CCRP delivery.
     Keep the Flight Path Marker aligned with the Steering Line. This will align your aircraft with the target
     even though the target will be out of sight.
     The Steering Cue will fall down the Steering Line as the range decreases and the weapon is about to
     be released. Time to release counts down at the lower right of the HUD.

        Target Designator




     Monitor the Pull-Up Anticipation Cue to ensure it does not go above the Flight Path Marker. The Pull-
     Up Anticipation Cue (PUAC) provides a visual representation of the altitude required for the bomb
     fuze to arm or altitude to initiate a pull-up to avoid impacting the ground, whichever is more
     immediate. It moves up toward the Flight Path Marker (FPM) as the aircraft loses altitude. Releasing
     a bomb with the FPM below the PUAC will not give the bomb time to arm and result in a dud.
5.   Press and HOLD the Weapon Release button.
     When the Solution Cue begins to move down the Steering Line, about 10 seconds prior to release,
     press and hold the Weapon Release button. This provides the fire control computer consent to
     release the weapon.
     Keep the Flight Path Marker aligned with the Steering Line. This will align your aircraft with the target
     even though the target will be out of sight.

     Hold the Weapons Release button long enough to ensure all weapons come off. The FPM flashes
     after weapons are released.
     Execute a 30-45 degree check turn to the left or right to avoid overflight of the target and possible
     TGP gimbal roll. Continue to track the target in the TGP and update the crosshair aimpoint if
     necessary.

7.   Lase the target with the TGP.
     Squeeze the Trigger to lase the target no later than 8-12 seconds prior to impact. The L flashes when
     the laser designator is firing. At impact, the screen will wash out from the IR energy of the explosion.




     Switch to a wide field of view for an assessment and documentation of target damage. Set up for a
     re-attack if necessary or exit the area.
JOINT DIRECT ATTACK MUNITIONS (JDAM)
JDAM is an inertial and GPS guidance kit that can be attached to the Mk. 82 or Mk. 84 general-purpose bombs.
When released, the aircraft downloads the target coordinates to the JDAM. The JDAM then guides to those
coordinates. The weapon is completely fire-and-forget but cannot be steered or re-targeted post-launch.

Arming Delay. Selects the delay between weapon release and arming. Options are 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5,
8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 14, 21, and 25 seconds.
Fuzing Option. Sets the fuzing option:
     •    AIR: Weapon will air-burst above the target. This reduces the penetrative effect of the bomb but
          improves its area effect.
     •    GND: Weapon will explode on impact. Selecting GND will reveal an additional option labeled FD
          (fuzing delay). Selectable fuzing delays are 0 (instant), 5, 15, 25, 45, 60, 90, 180, and 240
          milliseconds. Adding a fuzing delay allows the weapon to penetrate the target prior to exploding.
     •    GND DLY: Weapon will impact target inert, and then explode after an extended period. Selecting
          GND DLY will reveal an additional option labeled FD (fuzing delay). Selectable fuzing delays are
          0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours after impact.
Impact Angle. Sets the angle that the bomb will attempt to impact the target at (e.g., 60°). A higher impact
angle should be used if tall structures surround the target.
Impact Azimuth. Sets the heading that the bomb will attempt to fly to the target during the terminal phase. A
value of “0” means no specific heading; use a value of “360” if you want the bomb to impact the target from the
south flying north.
Impact Vertical Velocity. Sets the vertical velocity the bomb will attempt to achieve when impacting the target,
in feet per second. A higher vertical velocity creates more effective penetration.

WIND-CORRECTED MUNITIONS DISPENSERS
Wind-Corrected Munitions Dispensers (WCMD, pronounced “wick-mid”) are tail kits that can be equipped to a
CBU-87 CEM or CBU-97 SFW, giving the precision guidance capability. WCMD includes an onboard INS and
can be programmed with the winds aloft to improve accuracy.
When the CBU-87 is equipped with WCMD, it is called the CBU-103. A CBU-97 with WCMD is called a CBU-
105.

AGM-88 HARM
The AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) is a supersonic, passive radar-guided air-to-ground
missile intended to strike air defense radar sites and vehicles. The missile has an onboard radar receiver that
homes in on radar energy emitted by ground-based radars, making it fire-and-forget. The pilot can designate
targets using the missile’s onboard radar receiver, or using the separate HARM Targeting System (HTS) pod
(not yet implemented). The HARM may be loaded on stations 3, 4, 6, or 7, but is only flight-certified for stations
3 and 7.
The HARM can be targeted using its onboard radar receiver in one of three modes: position known (POS),
HARM-as-sensor (HAS), or datalink (DL). Currently, DL is not implemented in DCS.
Communication with the HARM missile is managed by the aircraft launcher interface computer (ALIC) onboard
the LAU-118 pylon. The ALIC provides HARM sensor video to the SMS and allows the SMS to hand off threat
types to the AGM-88. The AGM-88 will home in on threats matching the handed-off threat type after launch.

Threat table: Displays the current threat table (TBL1, TBL2, or TBL3). Pressing cycles through the three tables.
Pressing the TMS switch left when the WPN page is SOI also cycles through threat tables.
FOV: Displays the missile field of view: “CTR” for center, “LT” for left, “RT” for right, and “WIDE” for wide.
Pressing cycles through FOV settings. The FOV setting controls which portion of the missile’s forward
hemisphere it searches. Pressing the FLCS pinky switch also cycles FOV settings.
Search filter: Pressing this OSB allows the pilot to toggle on and off threats within the current threat table.
Reducing the number of threats that the ALIC is searching for reduces the time for each scan cycle.
HARM UFC: Pressing this OSB displays the HARM page on the DED, where threat tables can be modified.
DTSB: The detected target status box lists detected threat types. When a new threat is detected, its type (e.g.,
“2” for SA-2) is added to the DTSB.
Scan counter: This counter increments after each successive scan made by the AGM-88.
Restart search: Pressing this OSB cancels the current scan cycle and begins a new one.
ALIC video: Detected threats are displayed in this area. Only threats from the active threat table are displayed.
ALIC video is ground stabilized and referenced to missile boresight line. Threats displayed as characters
representing their type (e.g., “2” for SA-2). If the threat is active (radiating), the letter “A” follows the threat type.
If the threat is tracking (guiding an in-flight missile), the letter “T” follows the threat type. If the threat is not
radiating (memory threat), or multiple threats of the same time are co-located, no “A” or “T” is shown.
Pressing TMS forward commands designation of the threat under the TDC. The ALIC video display will switch
to a non-ground-stabilized display of the targeted threat, with crosshairs indicating missile boresight.




Station: Shows which stations have AGM-88s loaded. The station selected for next launch is boxed. A “D” or
“F” is displayed over the station number to indicate a degraded or failed missile.
TDC: The target designator cursor is slewed over a target the pilot wishes to designate, using the cursor control
on the TQS. Pressing TMS forward commands designation of the threat under the TDC, and hands off the
threat type to the AGM-88.
Boresight: Indicates the missile boresight axis.
Scan time: Shows worst-case scan time. The ALIC will repeatedly scan for threats according to the chosen
parameters. Reducing the number of threats to be scanned using the SRCH OBS, or reducing the FOV, will
reduce the scan time and therefore decrease the amount of time before a threat is detected.
Threat types: The five threat types for the current threat table (TBL1, TBL2, or TBL3) are shown along the left
side. If a threat is designated, its type is highlighted. The adjacent OSBs have no function in the HAS sub-

On the right side is the HARM Launch Scale (HLS), which indicates the range potential of the missile to reach
the current target. The target is assumed to be at the current steerpoint. The SMS estimates both the aircraft
maneuver zone (AMZ), and the missile maneuver zone (MMZ). The AMZ is the zone where the missile can
reach the target if the launching aircraft lofts or turns towards the target first. The MMZ is the zone where the
missile can reach the target by doing entirely its own maneuvering.
FOV box: Indicates the end-game field-of-view of the HARM. The FOV box flashes when the aircraft is within
the missile maneuver zone, target handoff is completed, and the missile is ready to be fired.
HLS: The HARM launch scale (HLS) staple represents the combined AMZ and MMZ; in other words, the
ranges at which the missile can reach the target with or without aircraft maneuvering. The horizontal dash within
the staple indicates the top of the MMZ range and the bottom of the AMZ range. The bottom of the staple
indicates minimum launch distance. The pickle button is only hot when the staple is within the MMZ.
The HLS and all associated symbology are inhibited in HAS mode.
Current range, required loft angle: The position of the caret along the staple represents the current aircraft
range to target along the HLS range scale. If the caret is above the AMZ/MMZ separator, the aircraft must first
maneuver before the missile can reach the target. The number adjacent to the caret is the required loft angle to
place the aircraft within the MMZ. The loft angle is prefixed by an “A” when the aircraft is within the MMZ. The
caret is inhibited when in PB mode and more than 10° off-bearing.
Upper range scale: Will be either 40 or 80 NM, whichever is sufficient to cover the distance to the target.
Zero range: The bottom end of the HLS is a target distance of zero.
Min loft, optimal loft, max loft: The horizontal ticks along the azimuth steering line (ASL) indicate the
minimum and maximum loft required for the missile to reach the target. Maximum loft is the larger tick and
represents the loft angle that will give the missile maximum range. Minimum loft is the smaller tick and
represents the range where the missile would have to do a max-g pulldown to reach the target. In PB mode,
optimal loft is also shown as a pair of whiskers along the ASL. Optimal loft represents the loft angle that gives
the missile the maximum energy available at impact.
Loft cues are inhibited in HAS and POS/RUK modes.
Release altitude: The top number of this datablock is the predicted release altitude assuming the aircraft
makes a 4-g loft to the optimal loft altitude (or the maximum loft altitude if not within the MMZ).
Required turn: The bottom number of this datablock is the required turn to place the aircraft within the MMZ
(e.g., “L03” if a 3° left turn is required). Shows “00” if the aircraft is on-bearing but not yet within the MMZ range.
Once the aircraft is within the MMZ, this field shows the aircraft required turn to face the target (e.g., “L90” if the
aircraft nose is 90° right of the target).
This datablock is not displayed in HAS and POS/RUK modes.
Time to MMZ: Displays the estimated time until the aircraft reaches the MMZ. Displays “0:00” when the aircraft
is inside the MMZ. Not displayed in HAS or POS/RUK modes.
Bearing and distance to target: The bearing and distance (in nautical miles) from the aircraft’s present
position to the target. Not displayed in HAS mode.


HARM DED Page
The HARM DED page is accessed by pressing the LIST button on the UFC, then the 0/M-SEL button to select
MISC, and then the 0/M-SEL button again to select HARM. Note that the HARM option is only displayed when
AGM-88 is the selected on the SMS.
Pressing INC/DEC cycles through the three threat tables (TBL1, TBL2, and TBL3). Each threat table can store
up to five numeric threat IDs. Pressing the dobber switch up or down moves the cursor between slots. Use the
numeric buttons on the UFC to enter a new threat ID. Threat IDs supported in DCS are listed in ALIC Codes.


Preparation
Prior to departure, set up your threat tables as necessary. The threats you expect to fire against must be
present on at least one threat table for the HARM to detect them. Most of the time, you will be able to use one
of the default threat tables:
 TBL1 (MODERN SAMS)         TBL2 (AAA, SHORAD)           TBL3 (OLDER SAMS)
 10 (SA-10 FCR)             19 (SA-19 TAR)               3 (SA-3 TR)
 BB (SA-20 SR)              15 (SA-15 TELAR)             S (SA-3 SR)
 CS (SA-10 SR)              8 (SA-8 TELAR)               6 (SA-6 STR)
 11 (SA-11 TELAR)           A (ZSU-23-4 STR)             2 (SA-2 TR)
 SD (SA-11 TAR)             DE (DOG EAR MRCC)            13 (SA-13 TELAR)
If your expected threat does not appear on any of these tables, you will need to add it to one of the tables. You
will also improve your ability to efficiently employ HARMs if you consolidate expected threats onto a single
table.
To edit threat tables, first select air-to-ground master mode by pressing the A-G button on the ICP. Then, on the
SMS format, select AG88 as the active weapon type. Display the HARM page on the DED by pressing the LIST
button on the ICP, then the 0/M-SEL button to select MISC, and the 0/M-SEL button again to select HARM.




Use the INC/DEC rocker on the ICP to select a threat table, then use the dobber to place the cursor over a
threat you wish to edit. Use the ICP to enter a new threat number, then press the ENTR button.
Prior to employing HARMs, press the A-G button on the ICP to select air-to-ground master mode. Ensure that
the SMS and WPN formats are visible on an MFD. From the SMS format, power on the HARMs:




Prior to firing a HARM, ensure the MASTER ARM switch is in ARM.
Employment using Position Known (POS) Mode
  Summary
          1.     Select A-G Master Mode [2].
          2.     Set MASTER ARM switch to ARM.
          3.     Select AG88 on SMS page (OSB6).
          4.     Select POS sub-mode on the WPN page (OSB1).
          5.     Select the attack profile on the WPN page (OSB3).
          6.     Select the desired threat table and threat on the WPN page (OSB2).
          7.     Select the target steerpoint.
          8.     Fly to the AMZ, follow the loft and required turn cues, and wait until the FOV box on the
                 HUD is flashing.
          9.     Fire the missile using the weapon release button [RAlt]+[Space].

Position Known (POS) mode is a pre-planned employment mode that relies on a steerpoint being placed at or
near the target radar. The radar type will be downloaded to the ALIC, and the HARM will fly towards the target
steerpoint until the radar is detected, at which point it will home on the radar signal.
In POS mode, the pilot selects one of three attack profiles: Equations of Motion (EOM), Pre-Briefed (PB), or
Range Unknown (RUK). Each of these profiles makes different assumptions about the aircraft maneuver zone
(AMZ) and missile maneuver zone (MMZ). The AMZ is the zone where the missile can reach the target,
assuming the aircraft maneuvers to a required bearing and loft angle first. The MMZ is the zone where the
missile can reach the target without requiring the aircraft to turn or loft.
Equations of Motion (EOM) mode is the most effective profile for off-boresight launches but requires the most
accurate target steerpoint data. To launch with EOM selected, the pilot must first fly to the AMZ, then loft and
launch once within the MMZ. EOM is useful when attacking threats that require high off-boresight (HOBS)
defensive tactics.
Pre-Briefed (PB) mode is the most effective profile at longer ranges but requires an on-bearing attack. To
launch with PB selected, the pilot must first turn the aircraft to point at the target, then fly to the AMZ, then loft
and launch once within the MMZ. PB is most effective at longer ranges but requires the aircraft to fly directly at
the target.
Range Unknown (RUK) mode is the most versatile profile when working with degraded target data. To launch
with RUK selected, the pilot must fly the aircraft into the MMZ, where the missile can make all required
maneuvering to reach the target. RUK is much more tolerant of inaccurate target steerpoints, or when fighting
threats where only bearing information is available.
     1.        Select POS sub-mode on the WPN page.
               Press OSB1 if necessary to change to POS sub-mode. You will see the launch status divider line
               (LSDL) and next-launch information below the LSDL.
1.   Select the attack profile.
     On the WPN page, press OSB3 until the desired attack profile is shown.
2.   Select the threat table and threat.
     On the WPN page. press OSB2 until the desired threat table is shown, and then press the OSB
     adjacent to the threat you wish to attack from the list on the left side. This will hand off the threat to
     the ALIC.
3.   Select the target steerpoint.
     Activate the steerpoint co-located with the threat you are attacking.
4.   Fly to the AMZ, follow the required turn and loft cues, and wait until the FOV box on the HUD
     is flashing.
     The attack profile you will fly is dependent on whether you have selected EOM, PB, or RUK.
     EOM Attacks
     In EOM mode, you can launch from any relative bearing, as long as you follow the cues to the MMZ.
     First fly towards the target until the HLS range caret indicates that you are within the AMZ. If a
     required turn is indicated on the datablock below the HLS, turn as indicated until it reads “00”. (You
     do not necessarily need to be facing the target, as long as there is no required turn.) Then, pull up
     until the VVI is between the minimum and maximum loft cues on the ASL. When the FOV box is
     flashing, you can launch.
     PB Attacks
     In PB mode, you must be within 10° of bearing to the target. Once your aircraft is pointed towards the
     target, fly towards the target until within the AMZ. You will see the minimum, optimal, and maximum
     loft cues on the ASL. Pitch the aircraft to place the VVI between the minimum and maximum loft cues.
     When the FOV box is flashing, you can launch.
     RUK Attacks
     In RUK mode, you must fly the aircraft all the way to the MMZ. Follow the azimuth steering line (ASL)
     on the HUD towards the target until the FOV box on the HUD is flashing. Once it is flashing, you are
     within the MMZ and the weapon release button will be hot. For RUK attacks, the HARM will loft, but
     the loft angle will be limited to the maximum the missile can achieve while keeping the threat within its
     field of view.
               Because range information is degraded or unavailable for RUK attacks, no time-until-intercept or
               time-to-impact data is shown on the WPN page, and loft information is suppressed on the HUD.


Employment using HARM-as-Sensor (HAS) Mode
  Summary
          1.     Select A-G Master Mode [2].
          2.     Set MASTER ARM switch to ARM.
          3.     Select AG88 on SMS page (OSB6).
          4.     Select HAS sub-mode on the WPN page (OSB1).
          5.     Make the WPN page SOI.
          6.     Select the desired threat table on the WPN page (OSB2).
          7.     Wait until your threat appears in the ALIC video display on the WPN page.
          8.     Move the TQS cursor over the threat and designate with TMS forward [RCtrl]+[Up].
          9.     Fire the missile using the weapon release button [RAlt]+[Space].

HARM-as-sensor (HAS) mode is a target-of-opportunity employment mode using the HARM’s onboard radar
receiver. The HARM detects air defense radar signals and transmits that information to the aircraft. The pilot
can then select a radar to attack and launch a HARM against it. With this mode, distance to the target is not
known, only bearing, so the HARM does not loft, which decreases its effective range.
In HAS mode, the HARM repeatedly scans for threats that match the current active threat table. The HARM
begins with a full scan of its FOV, once for each of the selected threat types. If any targets are found, a detailed
scan is performed to determine the target coordinates. The HARM then steps to the next threat type. In all, this
results in a worst-case scan cycle time of 90 seconds.
The ALIC is in HAS mode when the master mode is A-G, AG88 is the selected weapon on the SMS page, and
“HAS” is displayed as the active sub-mode on the WPN page.
     1.        Select HAS mode and make WPN page SOI.
               Press OSB1 if necessary to change to HAS sub-mode. Ensure that the WPN page is SOI; if not,
               press DMS aft to change SOI to the WPN page.




     2.        Select the appropriate threat table.
     Press OSB2 or TMS left until the desired threat table is selected.
3.   Reduce the scan time by selecting only the threats you wish to scan for (optional).
     If you want to reduce scan time, press SRCH (OSB4), then leave highlighted only the threats you are
     interested in searching for.




     Press HAS (OSB1) to return to the HAS page.
4.   Select an FOV (optional).
     You can further reduce scan time by using the pinky switch (or OSB3) to cycle through FOV options
     until you find an appropriate FOV.
5.   Locate and designate your target.
     Point your aircraft (and the missile seeker) in the direction of your expected threat. As each scan
     cycle completes, detected threats will be shown in the ALIC video area and placed into the DTSB.
     Slew the cursor over the detected threat, then press TMS forward to designate it. The HAS display
     will change to indicate the designated threat.




     Note that you can designate and fire against any threat that appears on the HAS display, but many
     radar operators will cycle their radars on and off or track different targets. This will result in the HARM
     being unable to continue tracking the target, and the missile will become ineffective.
     To increase probability of kill, you may wish to wait until the threat radar is guiding a missile at you
     (“T” appears next to threat type on HAS display) before firing, since a radar operator is less likely to
     cease tracking you while guiding a missile. However, this strategy comes with its own obvious risks!
6.   Fire the missile.
     Verify the proper threat is highlighted, “RDY” is displayed in the SMS and WPN pages, and the FOV
     box in the HUD is flashing, then press and hold the pickle button to fire the missile.
AGM-65 MAVERICK
The AGM-65 Maverick is an optically guided air-to-ground missile intended for the close air support (CAS)
mission. It uses an onboard electro-optical (E/O) or infrared imager that tracks the target, giving it “fire and
forget” capability. The pilot locks the target using the image from the onboard seeker head and fires the missile.
The missile tracks to the target using the image from its seeker head.
The AGM-65 was developed by Hughes Missile Systems Division in 1966 and entered service in 1972.


Operation
The AGM-65 must be warmed up before it can be used. During the warm-up period, onboard image-stabilizing
gyroscopes spin up to operating speed. The missile’s video can be used before the gyroscopes have spun up,
but the image will not be ground stabilized.
Missile video will become available on the WPN page once the gyroscopes are spun up. If you wish to shorten
the warm-up period, pressing the Uncage button while the WPN page is SOI will activate missile video once the
gyroscopes have reached 90% of operating speed.
The pilot can locate and designate targets using the fire control radar (FCR) or heads-up display (HUD), using
the AGM-65’s own seeker head, or the pilot can handoff targets designated from the Sniper Advanced
Targeting Pod (TGP).
When handing off targets from the TGP, the missile boresight correlator (MBC) compares the image from the
targeting pod with the image from the missile seeker head and slews the missile seeker head until the images
match. The MBC is only active when in A/G mode with an AGM-65 selected, and the TGP is sensor of interest
(SOI).
When the Maverick is fired, its onboard imager continues to track the target until the target grows to fill about
75% of the seeker head field of view (FOV). At this point, to continue to impact, the Maverick uses forced
correlation.
The AGM-65 has a ground-configurable fuzing delay and a ground-selectable LAND/SHIP selector that
changes the tracking algorithm to be more suitable for vehicles or ships.

Preparation
The AGM-65 has a duty cycle of one hour in standby, and 30 minutes when active. After powering the
AGM-65s, the missiles will begin their 3-minute warm-up period. Once three minutes has passed, the missiles
are in standby mode and ready for employment. In standby mode, the missiles have one hour of available duty
time. Once a missile’s video is activated, it has 30 minutes of available duty time. When a missile’s duty time
has expired, it must be powered off for two hours.


Automatic Power-On
The SMS can be configured to automatically power on the Mavericks when crossing a configured steerpoint, so
that the pilot does not need to remember to power them on at least three minutes prior to employment.

  Summary
          1.     On the SMS format, select Mavericks.
          2.     Display the Control page.
          3.     Choose the steerpoint.
          4.     Choose the direction and enable auto power-on.


     1.        On the SMS format, select Mavericks.
               On the SMS format, press OSB6 until AG65 is shown as the active weapon.
2.   Display the Control page.
     Press the CNTL (OSB5) to display the Control page.




3.   Choose the steerpoint.
     Press OSB19, labeled STPT X.
          Using the OSBs, enter the steerpoint number, then press the OSB labeled ENTR. The Mavericks will
          be powered on upon crossing this steerpoint. You can press RCL to undo an errant digit, or RTN to
          return to the Control page without changing the steerpoint number.
     4.   Choose the direction and enable auto power-on.
          Press OSB20 (NORTH OF) to cycle between different direction options. The Maverick will not be
          powered on until the aircraft crosses the configured steerpoint traveling in generally this direction.
          Press AUTO PWR (OSB7) to turn on the automatic power-on feature.




          You can leave the Control page by pressing the CNTL (OSB5) again.


Missile Boresighting
Missile boresighting should be done prior to employing Mavericks using TGP handoff. It can be done either on
the ground or in the air while en route.
Summary
      1.     Power on the Mavericks and TGP.
      2.     Set GND JETT ENABLE ON, MASTER ARM SIM, A-G master mode [2], and A/G TGP
             mode.
      3.     On the SMS format, select AG65 and set E/O sub-mode to PRE or VIS.
      4.     On the TGP format, slew the seeker head to the boresight target.
      5.     On the WPN format, slew the seeker head to the same target and designate.
      6.     Press the BSGT button (OSB20).
      7.     Repeat steps 4–6 for each station.
      8.     Power off the Mavericks and reset all switches.


 1.        Power on the Mavericks and TGP.
           Place the TGP format on one MFD, and the SMS format on another.
           If the Mavericks are not already powered on: On the SMS format, press the PWR OFF (OSB7) to
           power on the Mavericks.




           If the TGP is not already powered on: Set the RIGHT HDPT power switch to on, on the SENSOR
           panel.
 2.        Set GND JETT ENABLE ON, MASTER ARM SIM, A-G master mode, and A/G TGP mode.
           If on the ground, set GND JETT ENABLE to ON. Press the A-G button on the ICP to switch to air-to-
           ground master mode. Set the MASTER ARM switch to SIM.
           If the TGP is not already in air-to-ground mode, then on the TGP format, press the OSB labeled
           STBY, then the OSB labeled A-G to put the targeting pod in A/G mode.
 3.        On the SMS format, select AG65 and set E/O sub-mode to PRE or VIS.
           On the SMS format, press OSB2 until PRE or VIS is shown as the Maverick sub-mode. (You can also
           use the cursor enable button on the TQS to cycle between delivery modes.) Use PRE if your
           boresight target is co-located with a steerpoint; use VIS if you are visually locating your boresight
           target. Confirm that AGM-65 PRE or VIS symbology is shown on the HUD. Choosing a target further
           away will reduce parallax errors.
     Change the MFD displaying the SMS format to the WPN format. On the WPN format, verify that NOT
     TIMED OUT is no longer displayed, indicating the missiles have completed their three-minute warm-
     up. The WPN page should begin displaying video from the missile seeker head.
4.   On the TGP format, slew the seeker head to the boresight target.
     Use DMS aft to move SOI to the TGP. Using the TQS cursor, slew the TGP pointing cross over the
     boresight target.




5.   On the WPN format, slew the seeker head to the same target and designate.
     Press DMS aft until SOI moves to the WPN format. Use the TQS cursor to slew the Maverick tracking
     gate over that same boresight target, then press TMS forward to designate. Verify that the tracking
     gate closes, and the correct target is being tracked.




6.   Press the BSGT button (OSB20).
     Press OSB20, labeled BSGT, to boresight the missiles.
     Press TMS aft to break missile track, then verify the missile LOS follows the TGP LOS.
     7.        Repeat steps 4–6 for each station.
               Press MSL STEP to move to the next pylon. Repeat this procedure for each pylon loaded with AGM-
               65s.
     8.        Power off the Mavericks and reset all switches.
               When you are finished boresighting your missiles, go back to the SMS format and press the OSB
               labeled PWR ON. This will prevent your Mavericks from running through their duty time before you
               enter the combat area.
               Be sure to reset the positions of the MASTER ARM and GND JETT ENABLE switches, as well as the
               master mode.


Employment using PRE mode
The PRE (pre-planned) delivery mode allows you to lock targets in the vicinity of a sensor point of interest (SPI),
such as a steerpoint. PRE uses CCRP-style HUD symbology, and the Maverick seeker head will be slaved to
the SPI.

  Summary
          1.     On the WPN format, set E/O sub-mode to PRE. Make sure WPN page is SOI.
          2.     Slew the tracking gate over the target and designate [RCtrl]+[Up].
          3.     Fire the missile [RAlt]+[Space].


     1.        On the WPN format, set E/O sub-mode to PRE. Make sure WPN page is SOI.
               On the WPN format, set the delivery mode to PRE using Cursor Enable or OSB2. The Maverick
               seeker head will be slaved to the SPI (typically the current steerpoint). Confirm that seeker head
               video is available.




               Press DMS aft until the WPN page is SOI.
     2.        Slew the tracking gate over the target and designate.
               Use the TQS cursor to slew the tracking gate over the target, then press TMS forward to designate.
               The tracking gate will close on the target. Confirm that the missile is tracking the correct target, the
               pointer cross is not flashing, and that the target is in range.




     3.        Fire the missile.
               Fire the missile with the weapon release button.


Employment using VIS mode
The VIS (visual) delivery mode allows you to lock targets that you can see in front of you, by using the HUD to
slew a TD box onto the target. VIS uses DTOS-style sighting. VIS mode is unavailable if the Mavericks are
loaded onto an LAU-88/A rack.

  Summary
          1.     On the WPN format, set E/O sub-mode to PRE.
          2.     On the HUD, slew the TD box over the target and designate [RCtrl]+[Up].
          3.     On the WPN format, slew the tracking gate over the target and designate [RCtrl]+[Up].
          4.     Fire the missile [RAlt]+[Space].


     1.        On the WPN format, set E/O sub-mode to PRE.
               On the WPN format, set the delivery mode to VIS using cursor enable or OSB2. SOI will move to the
               HUD, and a TD box will appear, initially caged to the flight path marker (FPM). Confirm that seeker
               head video is available on the WPN page.
2.   On the HUD, slew the TD box over the target and designate.
     Uncage the TD box and slew it over the target using the TQS cursor.
     Press TMS forward to designate the target in the TD box. The TD box will ground-stabilize and SOI
     will move to the WPN format.




     If the wrong target is designated, reject the designation by setting HUD as SOI using DMS forward,
     and then undesignate with TMS aft.
3.   On the WPN format, slew the tracking gate over the target and designate.
     Use TMS left or OSB7 to change video polarity, if desired.
     Use the TQS cursor to place the target within the crosshairs on the WPN format, then press TMS
     forward to designate the target. The crosshairs will close on the target. Confirm that the missile is
     tracking the correct target, the pointer cross is not flashing, and that the target is in range.
     4.        Fire the missile.
               Fire the missile with the weapon release button.


Employment using BORE mode
BORE (boresight) delivery mode is intended for quick reactive or target-of-opportunity shots. Missiles can be
launched against any target in BORE mode without having to change the SPI. In BORE mode, the Maverick
seeker head is slaved to the pointer cross on the HUD.

  Summary
          1.     On the WPN format, set E/O sub-mode to BORE.
          2.     On the HUD, fly the boresight cross over the target and designate [RCtrl]+[Up].
          3.     Fire the missile [RAlt]+[Space].


     1.        On the WPN format, set E/O sub-mode to BORE.
               On the WPN format, set the delivery mode to BORE using cursor enable or OSB2. SOI will move to
               the WPN format. Confirm that seeker head video is available. SOI will move to the WPN page and
               missile seeker head position will be displayed on the HUD as a cross. Seeker head position will
               initially be boresight.
2.   On the HUD, fly the boresight cross over the target and designate.
     Fly the pointer cross near your target, then use the TQS cursor to slew the pointer cross over the
     target. Reference both the HUD and the WPN format to correctly place the pointer cross, then press
     TMS forward to designate.




     Confirm that the missile is tracking the correct target, the pointer cross is not flashing, and that the
     target is in range.
3.   Fire the missile.
     Fire the missile with the weapon release button.
Employment using TGP handoff
The TGP can hand-off targets to the MBC, which will correlate the seeker head video with the TGP video and
attempt to automatically track the TGP target. To improve the likelihood of a successful handoff, perform the
steps listed in Missile Boresighting, above, prior to entering the target area.
You should have the TGP format active on one MFD and the WPN format active on the other.

  Summary
          1.     On the WPN format, set the delivery mode to PRE or VIS using cursor enable [Enter]
                 or OSB2. Confirm that seeker head video is available.
          2.     Using the DMS, move SOI to the TGP format [RAlt]+[.].
          3.     Using the TQS cursor, slew to the target. For a moving target, use TMS forward
                 [RCtrl]+[Up] to switch to POINT track. (For more information, see Fehler!
                 Verweisquelle konnte nicht gefunden werden..)

While the TGP is slewed, the MBC will command the seeker head to match slew and automatically attempt a
track. During the attempt, HANDOFF IN PROGRESS will be displayed on the WPN format. The amount of time
to complete correlation is reduced if the missile boresight procedure was completed prior to weapon
employment.
If handoff succeeds, a “C” (correlated) will be displayed over the active pylon number. There is no need to
switch SOI away from the TGP format. Confirm that the missile is tracking the correct target, the pointer cross is
not flashing, and that the target is in range, then press the weapon release button to fire.
If the handoff cannot succeed, “I” (impossible) is displayed above the pylon number instead.


Ripple Fire
Up to two Mavericks can be queued with separate targets for a ripple fire (a.k.a. “quick-draw”) attack. When
more than one Maverick is tracking a target, two 10-mr LOS circles will appear on the HUD, labeled “1” and “2”.
The AGM-65s must be loaded on LAU-117 pylons for ripple fire to be available.

  Summary
          1.     On the SMS format, set RP to 2 (optional).
          2.     Using one of the delivery modes above, designate a target for the first Maverick
                 [RCtrl]+[Up].
          3.     Press the MSL STEP button [S] to step to the next missile.
          4.     Designate a target [RCtrl]+[Up] for the second Maverick.
          5.     Fire both missiles.

     1.        On the SMS format, set RP to 2 (optional).
               Optionally, set the release pulses to two. To do this, from the SMS page, press OSB8 (labeled RP).
               Use the MFD to set the releases pulses to 2, then press ENTR (OSB2).
2.   Using one of the delivery modes above, designate a target for the first Maverick.
     Using one of the delivery modes above, locate and designate a target for the first Maverick. Confirm
     that the missile is tracking the correct target. Do not fire the missile.




3.   Step to the next missile.
     Press the MSL STEP button to step to the next missile.
4.   Designate a target for the second Maverick.
     Using the same procedure, locate and designate a target for the second missile. Confirm that the
     missile is tracking the correct target, the pointer cross is not flashing, and that the target is in range.
     On the HUD, LOS circles labeled “1” and “2” will indicate missile LOS and the order the missiles will
     fire in.
     5.        Fire both missiles.
               If you set releases pulses to two, press and hold the weapon release button until both missiles have
               come off the rail. If not, press and hold the weapon release button once for each missile (twice total).


Force Correlate
The AGM-65G and -H models can be launched in force-correlate mode. This mode does not use the normal
centroid tracking algorithm suitable for targeting vehicles, instead using an image-correlation algorithm suitable
for tracking elements within a picture. Force-correlate mode is useful when launching Mavericks against static
targets such as buildings and structures, when it is desired that the Maverick impact a specific part of that
structure. Instead of tracking the target centroid, the Maverick will strive to impact the exact part of the image
that was targeted (e.g., the base of an antenna).

  Summary
          1.     Using one of the delivery modes above, locate a target.

VIPS, VRPS, AND PUPS
The F-16 has the capability of displaying visual indicators to assist in making attacks from locations relative to
the target. These indicators can assist the pilot in knowing where the target is relative to a prominent visual
reference, where to commence the attack, and when to begin a pop-up attack. These visual indicators are
programmed using the Data Entry Display (DED) and are displayed on the HUD in pre-planned air-to-ground
sub-modes (e.g., CCRP).
A visual initial point (VIP) is used when the location of the target is not known precisely but is known relative
to a visually prominent object. For example, the target may be known to be five miles northwest of an
identifiable bridge. A visual reference point (VRP) is used when the pilot desires a visual indication of a
location to begin an attack (or otherwise reference relative to a known target position). A pull-up point (PUP) is
a location where a pop-up attack commences.
Note that a single steerpoint cannot have both a VIP and a VRP active.


Using Visual Initial Points
When a visual initial point is specified for a steerpoint, the steerpoint is treated as the initial point, and a target
indication is automatically shown relative to that steerpoint on the HUD. Navigation steering is provided to the
initial point, the idea being that the pilot flies to and visually acquires the initial point, and then performs an INS
update using an overfly or HUD designation. (At this time, INS updates are not implemented.) Once the initial
point location has been updated, the target designation should be directly on top of the actual target position.




 Visual Initial Point
 (steerpoint)
                                                                                                       Target




In the screenshot above, the location of the target (a factory) is known relative to a radio tower, marked as
steerpoint 1 and depicted as a diamond. The target is shown as a TD box.
To define a VIP, first ensure that you are in air-to-ground CCRP mode, then press LIST on the ICP, then “3”, to
show the VIP page. The VIP-TO-TGT page is then shown. Ensure the “VIP-TO-TGT” text is surrounded by the
cursor, and press “0” (M-SEL) to activate VIP-TO-TGT. (It will be displayed in reverse video when active.)
Dobber down to the VIP line and select the steerpoint located at the visual initial point. Dobber down to each
successive line and enter the bearing from the VIP to the target, then the range from the VIP to the target, and
finally the elevation difference from the VIP to the target. (To enter a negative number, first press “0” twice.)
On the HUD, a TD box will appear at the target location when in air-to-ground mode and when the VIP
steerpoint is active. Navigation steering will be to the VIP, and the ASL will reference the target.


Using Visual Reference Points
A visual reference point (VRP) is used when a target location is known, and the pilot wishes to mark a reference
point relative to the target. This could be a location to commence the attack from, the location of friendly forces,
etc. With a VRP, the steerpoint is the target point, and the reference point is defined relative to the target
steerpoint. (A VIP works the opposite way; the steerpoint is the reference point, and the target is defined
relative to the reference point).




                                                                                                  Target (steerpoint)



                                                                                                  Visual Reference
                                                                                                  Point




In the screenshot above, steerpoint 2 is over the target (TD box), and a visual reference point (diamond) is
defined relative to it.
To define a VRP, first ensure that you are in air-to-ground CCRP mode, then press LIST on the ICP, then “9”, to
show the VRP page. The TGT-TO-VRP page is then shown. Ensure the “TGT-TO-VRP” text is surrounded by
the cursor, and press “0” (M-SEL) to activate TGT-TO-VRP. (It will be displayed in reverse video when active.)
Dobber down to the TGT line and select the target steerpoint. Dobber down to each successive line and enter
the bearing from the target to the VRP, then the range from the target to the VRP, and finally the elevation
difference from the target to the VRP. (To enter a negative number, first press “0” twice.)
On the HUD, a diamond will appear over the VRP when in air-to-ground mode with the target steerpoint
selected. Both navigation and weapon release steering will be to the target, as normal.


Using Pull-Up-Points
A pull-up-point (PUP) is a location where a pop-up attack begins. Pull-up locations are typically precomputed to
allow an aircraft to make a preplanned pop-up attack with sufficient altitude and time to release weapons and
perform a safe-escape maneuver prior to reaching minimum safe altitude. Once these calculations are
completed, the pull-up point configured in the DED the aircraft and displayed on the HUD.




                                                                                                    Target (Steerpoint)



                                                                                                    Pull-Up Point




In the screenshot above, a pull-up point is defined relative to the target steerpoint. The target is depicted as a
TD box and the pull-up point is shown as a circle. If the pull-up point is outside the HUD FOV, the circle is
clamped to the edge of the HUD and drawn inscribed with an “X”.
To define a pull-up point relative to the target steerpoint, first ensure that you are in air-to-ground mode, then
press LIST on the ICP, then “9”, to show the VRP page. The TGT-TO-VRP page is then shown. Press DCS
Sequence to move to the TGT-TO-PUP page. Ensure the “TGT-TO-PUP” text is surrounded by the cursor, and
press “0” (M-SEL) to activate TGT-TO-PUP. (It will be displayed in reverse video when active.)
Dobber down to the TGT line and select the target steerpoint. Dobber down to each successive line and enter
the bearing from the target to the pull-up point, then the range from the target to the pull-up point, and finally the
elevation difference from the target to the pull-up point. (To enter a negative number, first press “0” twice.)
If you are using VIP sighting for a target, you can define the pull-up point relative to the VIP rather than the
target. To do this, first ensure that you are in air-to-ground mode, then press LIST on the ICP, then “3”, to show
the VIP page. The VIP-TO-TGT page is then shown. Press DCS Sequence to move to the VIP-TO-PUP page.
Ensure the “VIP-TO-PUP” text is surrounded by the cursor, and press “0” (M-SEL) to activate VIP-TO-PUP. (It
will be displayed in reverse video when active.)
Dobber down to the VIP line and select the visual initial steerpoint. Dobber down to each successive line and
enter the bearing from the VIP to the pull-up point, then the range from the VIP to the pull-up point, and finally
the elevation difference from the VIP to the pull-up point. (To enter a negative number, first press “0” twice.)
DEFENSIVE SYSTEMS
AZIMUTH INDICATOR (RWR)
Detected radars are displayed on the Azimuth Indicator (aka Radar Warning Receiver).
The Azimuth Indicator is a circular-shaped display on the left of the front dash that provides you a visual
representation of radar emitters around your aircraft. The display is in planview with your aircraft in the center.
As threats are displayed around the center of the display, the icons represent the azimuth direction to the threat.
For example: an icon of the left side of the display would indicate an emitter located off your left. In addition to
the icons, an audio system will alert you to the status of the radars detected (search, track, and launch).
The locations of radar emitters on the display do not necessarily correlate to emitter range from your aircraft.
The distance of the threat icon from the center of the display indicates radar signal strength. The closer the icon
is to the center of the display generally indicates the closer the radar is to you. Any time a new emitter symbol is
displayed on the azimuth indicator status change tone is generated by the system. Special tones are also
generated for specific threats or critical threat modes of operation.




A symbol can have three states on the display:
     •    If a symbol is displayed with no circle around it, it indicates that the radar is in acquisition/search
          mode. When a new emitter is detected, a new threat tone will be heard.
     •    If a symbol has a steady circle around it, it indicates that the radar is tracking/locked on to your
          aircraft. When being tracked by an engagement radar, you will be provided a radar lock tone.
     •    If a symbol has a flashing circle around it, it indicates that the radar is supporting a missile that has
          been launched at you. When being launched on by a radar-guided missile, you will hear a missile
          launch tone and the LAUNCH light to the left will illuminate.
Indicator lights and buttons are located just to the left of the display.
                                      HANDOFF. Not applicable.
                                      LAUNCH. Illuminates when a missile launch is detected.
                                      MODE. This button toggles between OPEN that can display the 16
                                      highest priority threats or PRI that will only show the five highest threats.
                                      UNKNOWN SHIP. Toggles display of emitter symbols of unknown
                                      weapon systems on and off.
                                      SYS TEST. Initiates the system self-test.
                                      T (TGT SEP). Separates symbols that cover each other on the azimuth
                                      indicator; the symbol with the highest threat priority remains in the right
                                      place.




The Threat Warning Aux panel on the left auxiliary console is used to power the RWR on and off.




SEARCH. Not used.
ACT/PWR. Not used.
ALTITUDE. Not used.
POWER. Toggles RWR system power on and off.
COUNTERMEASURES DISPENSING SET (CMDS)
Selection and release of countermeasures (chaff and flare) is accomplished through a cockpit panel, HOTAS
controls, and a Data Entry Display (DED) page.


CMDS Control Panel
The left auxiliary console is dominated by the countermeasures dispensing system. This system provides
protection against tracking radar, air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles. Protection is provided by ejecting chaff or
flare.




Status Display. The left side displays the status of the CMDS, GO or NO GO. The right side displays
DISPENSE READY when manual consent is required to dispense countermeasures in the SEMI or AUTO
mode.
RWR and JMR Source Switch. These do not control power to the RWR or ECM (Jammer) but rather enable
their data to be used by the CMDS for dispensing in the SEMI or AUTO modes.
MWS Switch. The missile warning system is not applicable to the block 50 f-16C.
JETT Switch. This enables jettisoning of countermeasures when positioned up to JETT. This switch functions
even when the CMDS is turned off.
Quantity Indicators. The quantity remaining of each countermeasures type is displayed. LO is displayed when
the bingo level set on the DED is reached. System failure messages are also displayed in these fields when
applicable.
CH (Chaff) and FL (Flare) Switch. These switches must be enabled to allow dispensing of chaff or flare
countermeasures.
PRGM Knob. This selects one of four pre-set countermeasures programs to be dispensed by HOTAS
command CMS forward.
MODE Knob. This selects the CMS operating mode.
     •    MAN – The selected manual program may be dispensed by positioning the CMS forward.
     •    SEMI – The aircraft systems determine the program to be dispensed based on the threat. Consent to
          dispense must be given by positioning the CMS aft.
     •    AUTO – The aircraft systems determine the program to be dispensed based on the threat.
          Countermeasures are dispensed automatically. This mode must also be enabled by positioning the
          CMS aft. It may be disabled by selecting CMS right.
     •    BYPASS – This is selected to allow manual dispensing of countermeasures when failures prevent the
          other modes from working.


HOTAS
On the stick, there is a four-place switch for countermeasures.




                      Countermeasures

Center. This is the OFF position and no dispense action is taken.
Forward. This dispenses the manual program selected on the CMDS Panel with the PRGM knob.
Aft. This gives consent to dispense the requested program when the MODE knob is in SEMI. This also enables
the AUTO mode when the MODE knob is in AUTO.
Left. No function.
Right. This disables the AUTO dispense mode.


CMDS DED Pages
The CMDS upfront controls are accessed from the LIST page by pressing 7 on the ICP. Pages may be cycled
through by positioning the DCS switch right to SEQ.
The default bingo quantities for CH (chaff) and FL (flare) are listed on the first page. These quantities may be
changed by placing the CMDS Mode knob in STBY and entering the new bingo quantity in each field.

                                                                                  Feedback Message
               Flare Bingo Quantity
                                                                                  Request Countermeasures Message
                          Not used
                                                                                  Bingo Message



Three voice message options may also be toggled on or off from this page.
Feedback (FDBK). This enables or disables the ‘Chaff Flare’ audio message that plays when a
countermeasures program has been initiated.
Request Countermeasures (REQCTR). This enables or disables the ‘Counter’ audio message that plays when
consent to release countermeasures is requested in the SEMI or AUTO mode.
BINGO. This enables or disables the ‘Low’ or ‘Out’ audio message that plays when the bingo quantity is
reached, or all countermeasures have been expended.
The next DED pages display the number of countermeasures and interval between release for each
countermeasure type. The values may be changed by manually inputting new quantities and intervals. The
CMDS Mode knob should be set to STBY before changing the programs using the DED pages.
The values shown are for the program displayed at the top right of the page. Any of the four programs may be
changed using the Increment/Decrement switch on the ICP to select each in sequence. The pages for chaff and
flare are identical so only the flare page is shown below.


                   Burst Quantity

                   Burst Interval                                                Manual Program Selection

                   Salvo Quantity

                   Salvo Interval




Burst Quantity. The number of countermeasures released per burst.
Burst Interval. The interval in seconds between countermeasures per burst. This is usually a very small value.
Salvo Quantity. The number of bursts commanded when release consent is given.
Salvo Interval. The time in seconds between each burst.
In the example above, two flares will be released every second for 10 seconds.
