# F-16C TACTICAL EMPLOYMENT OVERVIEW

The F-16C is an all-weather, multi-role, tactical fighter aircraft. The F-16C is capable of a variety of air-to-air and
air-to-surface missions such as Combat Air Patrol (CAP), Offensive Counter-Air (OCA), Defensive Counter-Air
(DCA), Air Interdiction (AI), and Close Air Support (CAS). However, the most notable of the F-16C’s missions has
been to replace the F-4G as the U.S. Air Force’s dedicated “Wild Weasel” platform for performing SEAD
(Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses).




The F-16C’s cockpit layout and fire control avionics are optimized for operation by a single-pilot, presenting the
most important information on the HUD and forward instrument panel, with numerous fire control and weapon
functions accessible via buttons and switches mounted directly onto the side stick and throttle grip. This cockpit
design allows the pilot to remain focused outside as much as possible, taking advantage of the all-around visibility
afforded by the F-16’s bubble canopy. The F-16’s mission systems and HUD symbology facilitate accurate low-
level strikes against ground targets, even when its navigation system has degraded in position quality. The
avionics and sensors are equally capable of pinpoint strikes against pre-planned targets or against targets of
opportunity that have been visually identified by the pilot.
Regardless of the type of mission the F-16 is performing, pre-mission planning is the most important part of any
successful combat mission, particularly when performing an air-to-surface strike on a target protected by hostile
air defense systems. As in the case with other military aircraft, factors such as terrain, weather, and threat
locations should be considered when planning ingress and egress routes; and the speeds and altitudes to be
flown. Routes and altitudes should be selected to maximize survivability, reduce the probability of detection by
threat weapon systems, and, when necessary to fly through the Weapon Engagement Zone (WEZ) of enemy air
defense systems, minimize the time spent within the WEZ of such systems.
In addition, the desired weapon effects against the assigned target(s) will typically determine which munition
types will be appropriate for the mission, which in turn may determine the nature of the ingress routes and the
speed and altitudes that are utilized when conducting the attack itself. Conversely, the defenses surrounding the
target may preclude the use of specific routing and/or munition types, which may drive the planning process to
consider alternative routes and altitudes in order to achieve the same weapon effects.
Air-to-Air Missions
Air-to-air missions rely on effective
communication and coordination between
flight members, situational awareness,
and a firm understanding of Air Combat
Maneuvers (ACM). Regardless of the
specific mission that is being performed,
the flight leader must retain the initiative
by anticipating what the enemy may do
while simultaneously maneuvering the
flight in a manner to gain and maintain an
advantage in position and energy state.
Air-to-air engagements are divided into
two distinct phases of combat: Beyond
Visual Range (BVR) and Within Visual
Range (WVR).

Beyond Visual Range (BVR) Combat
BVR is the phase in which the majority of modern-day air-to-air engagements begin. The key to BVR combat is
termed as “first look, first shot, first kill”, which is the ability to detect, shoot, and kill hostile air threats before
they can achieve the same opportunity. This is dependent on detecting the presence of enemy aircraft as soon
as possible, positioning the flight in a manner in which long-range air-to-air missiles may be employed against
the enemy aircraft at the furthest range that is tactically feasible, and successfully defeating any counterattack
that is taken against the flight.
Detection
BVR combat is typically reliant on the use of radar for detection, tracking, and missile guidance against enemy
aircraft at long range. However, in some cases electro-optical sensors such as telescopic cameras or infrared
search & track (IRST) systems may be utilized. In addition, electronic datalinks may also be incorporated to
enhance the collective situational awareness of each flight member by sharing sensor data across networks of
multiple aircraft.
Like most sensors, radar has some key advantages and disadvantages. Radar can detect the presence of aircraft
at ranges well beyond that which the pilot can visually see with the unaided eye, and can calculate the precise
position, altitude, and velocity of detected aircraft. Unfortunately, radar alone cannot determine the allegiance of
an aircraft, which is referred to using the brevity term “bogey” to describe an aircraft of unknown identity or
affiliation. However, in the case of the F-16C, the APG-68 Fire Control Radar (FCR) incorporates a function known
as Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) to identify the specific type of aircraft, along with the APX-113
Advanced Identification-Friend-or-Foe (AIFF) interrogator to determine if a detected aircraft is potentially hostile,
which is referred to using the brevity term “bandit”. Further, the APG-68 FCR is limited to the forward sector only,
and requires several moments to mechanically scan the airspace within its entire scan volume.
When operating as a flight, radar coverage may
be allocated to each flight member using azimuth
and/or altitude sectors, which allows each flight
member to scan a smaller volume of airspace.                                             Each flight member scans half

increases the likelihood of detecting enemy               100° of combined coverage

decide on a course of action earlier and act
accordingly. This can be especially advantageous                        60° Azimuth

                                                                                         probability at increased range
Alternatively, when patrolling an area where the
flight must maintain a position within an assigned
area, such as a combat air patrol orbit, it will
often be necessary to split the flight to opposing
                                                                              Radar Sector Delineation
sides of the patrol orbit, with the orbit itself
aligned with the anticipated vector from which
enemy aircraft are expected to approach.
In such a situation in which the flight consists of two aircraft, at least one aircraft will maintain their radar oriented
toward the anticipated threat vector while the other is on the opposite side of the orbit. This sequence allows the
anticipated threat vector to be monitored by at least one flight member’s radar, with only brief periods of time in
which the threat vector is not being monitored as both aircraft are in a turn. When performed with a flight of
four, each 2-ship element may be staggered to permit uninterrupted radar coverage.

Even when supported by AWACS aircraft such as the E-3, the flight should not solely rely on the surveillance
information provided by the datalink network for detection of enemy aircraft. AWACS or other contributing sensors
on the datalink network may not have the same line-of-sight or proximity to potential threats compared to one’s
own flight. Rather, datalink information should be utilized to augment the collective situational awareness of the
flight members or provide early warning beyond the range of the flight’s own sensors.
Committing to the Engagement
Once aircraft are detected and determined to be hostile (“bandits”) and the Flight Lead has decided to commit
to an engagement, the flight must orient themselves appropriately to ensure they are in the most advantageous
position and energy state for the impending engagement. The flight should align their course with an appropriate
intercept vector that will allow them to engage the bandits from the desired aspect angle for the given tactical
situation. If intending to engage the bandits from an aspect angle that will guarantee the maximum kinematic
performance of their missiles, the flight should align to an approximate intercept vector that will place the bandit
aircraft directly in front of the flight when the onboard missiles would achieve their maximum range, thereby
minimizing the course corrections the missiles must perform after launch.
                                                                                Maximum kinematic             Maximum launch

                               Intercept vector for maximum missile performance

The Flight Lead should consider the formation of the flight itself, in that each flight member’s position, spacing,
and altitude relative to one other is properly set for a BVR engagement. When entering a BVR engagement, the
Flight Lead should select a formation that best suits the tactical situation, which maximizes firepower where it is
needed without sacrificing the ability for the flight to provide mutual support or maneuver defensively if necessary.
The Flight Lead should also consider the flight’s altitude and velocity. Launching a missile from higher altitudes
and higher speeds will increase the kinematic performance of the missile. Conversely, launching a missile at lower
altitudes where the air density is higher will result in increased drag on the missile, and launching from a lower
speed will result in the missile attaining less total kinetic energy before its rocket motor is depleted.

                                               Missile kinematic range at launch

By positioning the flight at higher altitudes and increasing velocity prior to launch, enemy aircraft may be engaged
from a greater distance. However, inducing a radar look-down situation may also have a negative effect on the
flight’s own radar performance, depending on the bandit’s range, aspect, relative altitude, and radar cross section
(RCS). Additionally, a higher closure rate will compress the engagement timeline, forcing the Flight Lead to make
decisions faster and requiring the flight as a whole to react quickly to an evolving tactical situation.
Engagement
The tactics and techniques of conducting a BVR engagement will vary greatly depending on the tactical situation,
the composition of the flight, the weapons load amongst the flight members, and the type of enemy aircraft the
flight is expecting to encounter, especially with consideration to the sensor and weapon capabilities of the enemy
aircraft. In the case of the F-16C, the only type of weapon that may be employed in a beyond visual range
engagement is the AIM-120, which is an active radar-homing missile that permits simultaneous engagements of
multiple targets by autonomously tracking its target using an onboard active radar seeker for terminal guidance.
As mentioned above, the kinematic performance of the missile will be
affected by the launching aircraft’s altitude and velocity at the moment
of launch. However, the maximum range at which a target may be
engaged will be determined by a combination of the missile’s kinematic
performance and the aspect angle and closure rate of the targeted
aircraft relative to the launching aircraft. If the targeted aircraft is         “Hot”
approaching from a head-on or “hot” aspect, the target may be engaged                               “Flanking”
at a greater range. If the targeted aircraft is flying away in a tail-on or
“cold” aspect, the target must be engaged from a closer range.
                                                                                                                        “Cold”
Further, if the targeted aircraft is approaching from a “hot” aspect but
is flying at a low speed, the target must be engaged from a closer range
due to the reduced closure rate with the missile. If the targeted aircraft
is flying away in a “cold” aspect but is flying at a low speed, the target
may be engaged at a greater range due to the increased closure rate
the missile will have to catch up to the target. These two factors, aspect
angle and relative closure rate, will determine the maximum launch                              Aspect Angle
range of a missile against a target, also known as RMAX, for a given set
of launch conditions.
In the figure below, each bandit is flying at the same velocity, and each missile that is fired is being launched
under identical conditions with the same kinematic range. However, due to the aspect angle of each bandit, the
range (RMAX) at which each target can actually be engaged will be drastically different solely based on the aspect
angle. In the same scenario, if the “Hot” bandit were to increase velocity, the RMAX would also increase; but if the
“Cold” bandit were to increase velocity, the RMAX would inversely decrease.
                                                                       Maximum kinematic

                                              “cold” bandit                              “flanking” bandit   “hot” bandit

                       Missile maximum launch range (RMAX) based on aspect angle

In addition, if the bandit aircraft were to defensively maneuver after the missile is launched, the missile would be
required to expend kinematic energy to adjust its course to a new intercept vector. If a bandit is flying directly
toward the flight (“hot” aspect) and is engaged at the absolute maximum range, the missile may be kinematically
defeated if the bandit simply changes its aspect. Therefore, the Flight Lead must anticipate the possibility of such
an action when considering engagement tactics.
Conversely, aspect angle may be exploited by the ownship after a missile is launched at the enemy aircraft. After
missile launch, the ownship may turn, or “crank”, to one side until the ownship radar is near its antenna gimbal
limit. This maneuver will reduce the ownship’s closure rate with the bandit, allowing the ownship to prolong
standoff range from the bandit and potentially complicate the employment of enemy missiles against the ownship,
especially if the bandit aircraft is equipped with missiles that have a shorter range compared to the AIM-120.
It is worth noting that if the targeted bandit is simultaneously attempting to engage the ownship, performing a
crank maneuver may cause the bandit to adjust course as well. This may reduce the kinematic range of the
ownship’s missile while in flight as it will need to alter its course to maintain an optimal intercept vector on the
targeted bandit. If the ownship’s missile was launched at the absolute maximum kinematic range, the crank
maneuver itself could reduce the probability of a successful engagement, depending on the relative closure rates.

                                          Post-launch “Crank” maneuver

Once the missile’s onboard radar seeker activates to begin terminal tracking of the enemy aircraft, the radar
signals emitted from the missile seeker itself may alert the targeted bandit to the attack, resulting in the bandit
aircraft initiating defensive maneuvers and/or employing countermeasures in an attempt to defeat the missile. At
this point in the engagement, the Flight Lead must make a decision as to how to continue the engagement.
The launching aircraft could turn toward the bandit to be in a position to continue with the engagement in the
event the bandit survives the missile encounter. Alternatively, the launching aircraft could turn away from the
bandit to maintain standoff and keep the engagement at beyond visual range. If the wingman or second element
of the flight were following at a staggered distance behind the launching aircraft, the remainder of the flight could
continue the engagement while the launching aircraft turns away to maintain standoff.
Turning away from the bandit may also ensure a kinematic advantage against any missiles that may have been
launched by the bandit aircraft before it was forced to initiate defensive maneuvers. Although the bandit will
likely be forced to maneuver in a manner that results in losing a radar lock on the ownship, thereby defeating
any semi-active radar-homing missiles that were launched by the bandit, any active radar-homing missiles
launched by the bandit may have already begun terminal guidance. If that is the case, the enemy active radar-
homing missile(s) will now be at a kinematic disadvantage in a tail chase.
In some instances, it may be advantageous to launch a long-range
radar-guided missile even if the bandit aircraft is not yet within
maximum launch range, with the intent to force the bandit into
defensive maneuvers or break up a formation of several enemy aircraft.
By launching in advance, the radar signals emitted from an incoming
active radar-homing missile in terminal guidance may prompt the
bandit to initiate defensive maneuvers in an attempt to defeat the                                Bandit is forced into

have superior engagement range over the AIM-120), giving the
ownship additional time to reduce the range to the extent that a follow-
up missile may be launched with a higher probability of successful
interception. In addition, if multiple bandit aircraft were operating
together in a formation, forcing one or more bandits to defensively
maneuver may allow the flight to regain the initiative, prevent the
bandits from mutually supporting one another for a brief time, or more
easily target individual enemy aircraft.

altitude during the maneuvers themselves. This may grant a temporary
kinematic advantage to the ownship flight while imposing a kinematic
disadvantage on the bandit. However, as noted before, although an
altitude advantage does provide a kinematic advantage during a BVR
missile engagement, inducing a radar look-down situation may also
have a negative effect on the flight’s own radar performance,
depending on the bandit aircraft’s range, aspect, relative altitude, and
radar cross section (RCS).                                                         First missile launched

It is also worth noting that, depending on the total quantity of long-            beyond maximum range
range missiles that are available within the flight, deliberately
expending missiles in an opening engagement with a low probability of                 Long-range offensive
success may not be advisable. If the number of opposing bandit aircraft                missile engagement
meets or exceeds one’s own flight, the Flight Lead should consider the
tactical implications of expending missiles in such a manner.
Defense
When under attack by long-range missiles launched from enemy aircraft, defensive countermeasures may be
employed to either electronically defeat the guidance of the missile or the kinematically defeat the missile itself.
In the case of the former, the missile guidance may be disrupted by expending chaff cartridges to degrade the
tracking solution of the bandit aircraft’s radar (in the case of semi-active radar-homing missiles) or the missile’s
onboard radar seeker (in the case of active radar-homing missiles); or electronic “jamming” emissions against
the radar may be employed. However, such defensive measures may be negated if the bandit’s radar or the
missile itself possesses counter-countermeasures in the form of chaff rejection algorithms or “home-on-jam”
capabilities, especially when facing an enemy with modern, sophisticated aircraft or weapons.
In the case of the latter, the missile may be kinematically defeated by forcing the missile to expend energy by
altering its course and/or descending to lower altitudes to increase the total drag acting against the missile body
and control surfaces. Once a missile’s rocket motor is expended, it must rely on its remaining kinetic energy for
maneuvering. If the missile needs to change its flight path, it must use its control surfaces to alter the angle-of-
attack against its external airfoils and missile body. Like any airfoil, increasing the angle-of-attack of the airflow
against the airfoil itself will also increase the aerodynamic drag acting upon it. Therefore, the more maneuvers a
missile must perform, the more drag will be incurred, reducing the missile’s kinetic energy. When launched from
higher altitudes, or if the missile performs a post-launch “loft” maneuver, the missile can leverage the force of
gravity to convert its potential energy (i.e., altitude) to kinetic energy, thereby gaining additional kinematic range.
However, unlike a missile, an aircraft has the advantage of an onboard engine, or engines, that allows it to
maintain or gain energy for maneuvers. This grants an aircraft kinematic sustainment that can be used to delay
or eventually defeat an enemy missile, which is otherwise limited to a finite amount of kinematic energy.
If the targeted aircraft aggressively alters its course, the missile must recalculate a new intercept trajectory and
then alter its own course accordingly. This maneuver incurs drag which causes the missile to lose kinetic energy.
If the targeted aircraft alters its course again, the missile must once more expend kinetic energy to alter its own
course to maintain an intercept. Contrarily, the targeted aircraft may use engine thrust to maintain its kinetic
energy during moderate maneuvers or regain kinetic energy following aggressive maneuvers. This means that
for every defensive maneuver the aircraft performs in which it drastically alters its flight path, the total kinematic
advantage the missile may have over the aircraft is incrementally reduced.

                             Defensive maneuvers against long-range missile attack

If the enemy missile is forced to expend enough kinetic energy, the missile will eventually slow down to the point
it will not be able to achieve a successful intercept, or even maintain stable flight, and will simply fall from the
sky. When engaged from long range, only a few defensive maneuvers by the targeted aircraft have the potential
to reduce the missile’s kinematic range to an extent that it cannot achieve an intercept, and the targeted aircraft
simply needs to turn away from the missile, resulting in a tail chase that the missile cannot overcome.
Another method of reducing a missile’s kinematic range is by decreasing altitude. By descending into thicker
regions of the atmosphere, the increased air density will increase the total drag acting upon the missile, further
reducing its kinetic energy. This may also induce a radar look-down situation which may degrade the radar
tracking solution from the bandit aircraft or an active radar-homing missile’s onboard radar seeker. However, it
is worth noting that this will also grant the bandit an altitude advantage for subsequent attacks, so the necessity
of such a defensive tactic must be weighed between defeating the immediate threat posed by a launched missile
versus the potential threat posed by a subsequent attack.
Within Visual Range (WVR) Combat
WVR combat is one of the most challenging environments a fighter pilot may encounter and requires significant
skill and proficiency. Close range aerial combat is very dynamic, and mistakes or miscalculations can result in
lethal consequences within seconds. If BVR is a game of chess, WVR is hand-to-hand combat in which offense
and defense must be performed simultaneously, instantly, and instinctively, in which either pilot may find
themselves gaining or losing the upper hand at any moment.
Many advantages provided by sophisticated sensors and weapons – or even stealth – are negated by the fact
that close-range aerial combat places one’s own aircraft in a position to be engaged by any of the enemy aircraft’s
weapon systems, such as highly-maneuverable short-range air-to-air missiles, and compresses the reaction time
to deploy countermeasures or defensive maneuvering to nearly zero. Even when facing an enemy aircraft with
inferior maneuverability and a lower thrust-to-weight ratio, granting an enemy pilot an opportunity to engage
one’s own aircraft in a maneuvering “dogfight” is a tactical risk that should be avoided if possible.
During air-to-air combat within visual range, fighter pilots must employ elements of BFM and ACM.
Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM). BFM is characterized as maneuvering one’s own aircraft to exploit positional
and attack geometry in order to place the enemy aircraft, or “bandit”, within the weapons envelope of one’s own
aircraft while simultaneously preventing the bandit from doing the same thing.
Air Combat Maneuvers (ACM). ACM is characterized as two friendly aircraft employing BFM while working as
a team to engage or avoid one or more bandits; or to extend and escape from WVR combat altogether, if possible.
Positional Geometry
The position and orientation of one’s own aircraft in relation to the bandit can be expressed using the factors of
aspect angle, angle-off, and range.
•    Aspect Angle. The position of the attacking aircraft in relation to the targeted aircraft’s tail, where an
     aspect angle of 0° would mean the attacking aircraft is directly behind the target and 180° would mean the
     attacking aircraft is directly in front of the target. In practical terms, as the aspect angle increases, the
     relative closure rate will tend to increase and the time within which a bandit will be within the weapons
     envelope of the ownship will decrease.
•    Angle-Off. The relative heading of each aircraft, where an angle-off of 0° would mean the nose of each
     aircraft are pointed in the same direction and 180° would mean the nose of each aircraft is pointed in
     opposing directions. In practical terms, as the angle-off increases, the flight paths of the aircraft will diverge
     and the amount of aiming “lead” that will be required to employ weapons against a bandit will increase,
     which will complicate a gun engagement and may reduce the probability of a successful missile engagement.
•    Range. The straight-line distance between each aircraft. In practical terms, as the range increases, the
     time within which a bandit will be within the weapons envelope of the ownship will increase, which may
     improve the probability of a successful missile engagement but will greatly complicate a gun engagement
     due to the increased time-of-flight and trajectory compensation that must be performed.

Attack Geometry
The flight path that is utilized to gain more favorable positional geometry, known as the pursuit course, is
determined by either the ownship’s lift vector or the ownship’s nose position relative to the bandit, depending on
whether the ownship is within the same plane of turn as the bandit.

                                 Lift vector relative to bandit’s plane of turn

The plane of turn can be thought of as a 2-dimensional disk around which an aircraft maneuvers. As any aircraft
maneuvers within a 3-dimensional volume of airspace, the flight path is determined by the forces of aerodynamic
lift and gravity. When maneuvering in a positive-G turn, the pilot directs the lift vector using roll and pulls aft on
the stick to induce a positive pitch motion, which alters the flight path using aerodynamic lift.
When maneuvering in a different plane of turn compared to the bandit, the pursuit course is determined by the
lift vector of the ownship. In this situation, the lift vector diverges from the bandit’s plane of turn and the ownship
is maneuvered into a 3-dimensional pursuit course in relation to the bandit’s plane of turn. This can be particularly
useful if intending to use gravity to maintain or regain kinetic energy, to lengthen one’s own flight path away
from the bandit to extend the range before employing a weapon, or to tighten one’s own turning radius to attain
an optimum position for employing a weapon.




                             Pursuit course outside the bandit’s plane of turn
When maneuvering within the same plane of turn as the bandit, the pursuit course is determined by the nose
position of the ownship relative to the bandit itself.
•    Lag Pursuit. If the nose position is behind the bandit, the ownship is in a lag pursuit course. In practical
     terms, a lag pursuit may be employed if the aspect angle is too high and the ownship does not have enough
     kinetic energy to maintain the required turn rate to keep the nose on the bandit, or the ownship requires
     more turning room than what the current range or closure rate allows.
•    Pure Pursuit. If the nose position is on the bandit itself, the ownship is in a pure pursuit course. In practical
     terms, a pure pursuit may be employed if the aspect angle is low enough and the ownship has enough
     kinetic energy to maintain the required turn rate and within the required turning room to keep the nose on
     the bandit. A pure pursuit can be useful in achieving an optimum position for weapons employment at low
     aspect angles.
•    Lead Pursuit. If the nose position is ahead of the bandit, the ownship is in a lead pursuit course. In practical
     terms, a lead pursuit may be employed to reduce the ownship’s turning radius within the bandit’s turn circle,
     or to increase the closure rate and/or reduce the range to the bandit. However, this requires that the
     ownship has enough kinetic energy and/or engine thrust to maintain the required turn rate and within the
     required turning room to keep the nose ahead of the bandit. A lead pursuit can be useful in achieving an
     optimum position for weapons employment at higher aspect angles, particularly if employing the gun, but
     doing so with a positive closure rate will likely require a constantly increasing turn rate that eventually results
     in being forced into a lag pursuit outside the bandit’s turn radius.

                              Pursuit course within the bandit’s plane of turn

Although a bandit may be engaged from outside the bandit’s plane of turn, the attack geometry will be more
complex and attaining the required targeting solution will likely be fleeting in nature. Particularly when engaging
a bandit with the gun, entering the same plane of turn as the bandit will simplify the targeting solution required
to achieve hits on the bandit.
Conversely, when attempting to avoid a gun attack from a bandit, significantly changing one’s own plane of turn
will also complicate the bandit’s targeting solution, forcing the bandit to adjust nose position and lift vector before
an acceptable targeting solution for a gun attack can be attained.
Turn Rate versus Turn Radius
When employing attack geometry to achieve more
favorable positional geometry for weapons
employment, the turn performance of each opposing
aircraft must be considered, which are expressed by
the factors of turn rate and turn radius.
•          Turn Rate. The time that is required for an
           aircraft to alter its flight path to a new direction
           is its turn rate. In practical terms, this is an
           expression of how quickly the aircraft can turn
           to a point the nose in a different direction.
•          Turn Radius. The space that is required for an
           aircraft to alter its flight to a new direction is its
                                                                                                 Turn Rate
           turn radius. In practical terms, this is an
           expression of how tightly the aircraft can turn
           to point the nose in a different direction.
Both factors must be considered together, in that
achieving the maximum turn rate for a given speed
may not result in the minimum turn radius, nor will
the minimum turn radius for a given speed result in
the maximum turn rate. The pilot must consider
what is more desirable throughout BFM: being able
to turn the aircraft within a metric of time or being
able to turn the aircraft within a metric of physical                            Turn Rate vs Turn Radius
distance.
Airspeed plays an important role in determining an aircraft’s turn performance. Since an aircraft must utilize
aerodynamic lift to alter its flight path, and aerodynamic lift is generated by air flowing across an airfoil, sufficient
airspeed must be attained to achieve the desired turn performance. As an aircraft performs a positive pitch motion
to increase the angle-of-attack (AoA, or “alpha”), the aerodynamic lift generated by the airfoils will increase,
tightening the turn. However, increasing the AoA will also increase aerodynamic drag, which will cause the aircraft
to slow down. This is overcome by increasing engine thrust during the turn; however, if the AoA is high enough
in that more drag is produced than the thrust from the engine can overcome, the aircraft will slow down.
At higher speeds, a given turn rate will result in higher G-forces. Once the aircraft reaches the maximum allowable
G-force that can be sustained, the turn radius will increase with airspeed. Conversely, if airspeed decreases, the
turn radius will also decrease. However, if the airspeed continues to decrease, so too will the aerodynamic lift
and the turn performance of the aircraft. Once the airspeed drops below a certain threshold, the aircraft will no
longer be capable of achieving the maximum allowable G-force. This threshold, at which the turn performance is
at its highest, is known as “corner velocity”.
                                             Turning            It is worth mentioning that some aircraft are designed with
           Turning                   Lift     Force             “high-alpha” (high angle-of-attack) maneuverability in mind.

                                                                increase aerodynamic drag, and “high-alpha” conditions will

                                                                can only be maintained for a few moments before the energy

                                                                rate, allowing the pilot to bring the nose to bear on an enemy
             Drag at high Angles-of-Attack                      aircraft for a “snapshot” engagement opportunity, doing so
                                                                will place the aircraft at an energy disadvantage.
The Flight Control System (FLCS) limits the F-16 turn performance based on angle-of-attack (AoA) and G-force
in such a manner that the F-16 does not have a specific corner velocity, but rather a “corner plateau” between
330 and 440 knots airspeed. This also means that the F-16 is not capable of employing high-alpha maneuvers.
•    At higher airspeeds, the limiting factor of the F-16’s turn performance is G-force. The turn rate and turn
     radius will increase and decrease accordingly with airspeed, based on a maximum G-force of 9 G. Once the
     airspeed drops below approximately 440 KCAS (knots, calibrated airspeed), the limiting factor of the F-16’s
     turn performance becomes angle-of-attack.
•    As the airspeed is reduced from approximately 440 to 330 KCAS (the “corner plateau”), the turn radius will
     decrease slightly while the turn rate will increase.
•    As the airspeed is reduced below approximately 330 KCAS, the turn radius will remain roughly the same,
     but the turn rate will decrease.
                                                                        Turn rate limited by max G

                                                     Turn Performance

It is worth noting that turn performance is greatly affected by gross weight and air density. At higher gross
weights, greater AoA will be necessary to generate the required aerodynamic lift to redirect the aircraft’s inertia
and alter the flight path. Accordingly, the increased AoA will generate more aerodynamic drag, requiring more
thrust from the engine to maintain the energy state of the aircraft. At higher altitudes and/or temperatures, lower
air densities will result in reduced aerodynamic lift, which will likewise require additional AoA.
As a result, the turn performance of the aircraft will decrease at higher altitudes and gross weights. Under such
conditions, the turn rate that may be sustained at maximum engine thrust may not reach the maximum G or
maximum AoA limits of the aircraft. The pilot may still elect to utilize the full turn performance of the aircraft in
this case, knowing that the current energy state cannot be maintained due to insufficient engine thrust, but doing
so should be done with consideration to the tactical situation. For example, a more aggressive turn may be
momentarily employed to achieve an optimum position for weapons employment, or to temporarily deny a bandit
the same opportunity, with the knowledge that doing so will expend energy and cause the airspeed to decrease.
However, such an action may prove tactically advantageous in that moment if the energy can be recovered.
The force of gravity itself will also affect the turning radius of the aircraft when the plane of turn is not parallel
with the surface of the Earth. When ascending and the flight path passes the vertical, gravity will pull the aircraft
in the same direction as the lift vector. This augments the aerodynamic lift with which the aircraft is turning,
tightening the turn itself and reducing the turn radius.
When descending and the flight path passes the vertical, gravity will pull the aircraft in the opposite direction
from the lift vector. This counteracts the aerodynamic lift with which the aircraft is turning, extending the turn
itself and increasing the turn radius.

In addition, altitude may be traded for airspeed, or vice versa. As altitude is potential energy and airspeed is
kinetic energy, one may be exchanged for the other during aerial maneuvers, as necessary.
If the pilot must perform a turn for which the engine thrust cannot maintain the current airspeed, the aircraft will
slow down. However, if sufficient altitude (potential energy) is available and the pilot incorporates a descent
throughout the turn, the force of gravity may be used to augment the engine thrust to maintain or regain airspeed
(kinetic energy). Thus, potential energy is traded for kinetic energy.
Alternatively, if the pilot must gain altitude and the engine thrust cannot maintain the current airspeed throughout
the ascent, the aircraft will slow down. However, if sufficient airspeed (kinetic energy) is available, aircraft inertia
may be used to augment the engine thrust to gain altitude (potential energy). Thus, kinetic energy is traded for
potential energy.
Entering the Merge
The tactics and techniques of conducting a close-range WVR engagement will vary greatly depending on the
tactical situation, the positional geometry as the flight merges with an enemy aircraft, and the type of aircraft
with which the flight has merged, especially with consideration to the maneuverability and weapon capabilities
of the enemy aircraft. Of particular note are whether the enemy aircraft’s strengths lie within its turn performance,
its thrust-to-weight ratio, and whether it has the capability to perform “high-alpha” maneuvers or employ high-
off-boresight missiles. These factors should drive how the enemy aircraft are engaged in close combat, in order
to leverage the strengths of one’s own aircraft while exploiting the weaknesses of the enemy aircraft.
Once two opposing aircraft have entered into close-
range BFM combat, this is referred to as becoming
“merged”. Prior to the merge itself, it is important to                                                      1
develop a plan for how to maneuver, attack, defend
against, and ultimately defeat the bandit with respect
to one’s own flight and the capabilities and tactics that
will likely be employed by the enemy aircraft. The most
important thing to remember is to avoid losing sight of
the bandit. In many cases during close-range combat,
the bandit will be outside of the FCR gimbal limits, any
position updates of an enemy aircraft received via
datalink will not be received fast enough, and the radar
warning receiver cannot be relied upon to warn of an
impending attack from IR-guided missiles or guns.
                                                                                        Bandit

When entering into a merge, performing a turn into the                                                      2
bandit before actually passing the bandit aircraft, which
is known as a lead turn, can be used to reduce the                    Bandit has positional advantage
angle-off and aspect angle. However, it is likely the                 if ownship does not turn outside
                                                                           the bandit’s turn circle
bandit will also attempt a lead turn against the ownship.
In this situation, the opposing aircraft will enter what is
known as a “two-circle fight”, in which the turn circle of
each aircraft is offset from one another.
A two-circle fight may also occur if the ownship is in an
offensive position behind the bandit, but at a range that
permits the bandit to perform a turn that sufficiently
increases the aspect angle and angle-off before the
ownship can enter the bandit’s turn circle. If the                                         Ownship
ownship does not turn into the bandit and enter a two-                2
                                                                                          Turn Circle
circle fight, the only option to avoid granting the bandit
positional advantage would be to accelerate and extend
the range to deny the bandit an opportunity to employ
a weapon against the ownship from a low aspect angle.
As the two aircraft pass, a high aspect missile shot may
be taken if equipped with an appropriate missile type.
However, one should be prepared for the bandit to
attempt the same, especially if the bandit is equipped
with all-aspect IR-guided missiles. Particularly when
positioned on opposing sides of the respective circles,
one should be prepared for brief opportunities to
employ missiles, especially if equipped with high-off-                1
boresight missiles such as the AIM-9X. Likewise, if the
bandit is equipped with high-off-boresight missiles as
well, or is capable of high-alpha maneuvers, one should
                                                                             BFM Two-Circle Fight
be prepared for the bandit to attempt the same.

                                                                  the bandit’s turn circle before the bandit can react, the

                           Ownship has positional                 aircraft will enter what is known as a “one-circle fight”, in
                          advantage if able to turn
                        inside the bandit’s turn circle           which the turn circle of each aircraft is essentially

                                                                  until an optimum position for weapons employment can

                                                                  maneuvers, the bandit may not need to employ a high-

               BFM One-Circle Fight                               sufficient positional advantage to permit such an attempt.
As the opposing aircraft continue in a two-circle or one-circle fight, the positional geometry must be continually
assessed to determine whether positional advantage is being gained or lost, whether a weapon may be
successfully employed, and when to be prepared to defend against a weapon employed by the bandit.

•    If the aspect angle is at the beam, the
     position is not ideal for weapon
     employment due to the high crossing
     rate and requires large amounts of lead.
•    If the aspect angle is high, one should
     be prepared to defend against a weapon
     employed by the bandit.                                    Assessing positional geometry from the bandit
When the bandit is in an offensive
position behind the ownship, the ownship
can exploit the available turning room to
increase a bandit’s aspect angle and
angle-off relative to the ownship to deny
or complicate the employment of a
weapon from the bandit against one’s
own aircraft.
In the example to the right, a bandit is
approaching from the 5 o’clock position,
with a low aspect angle and low angle-
off relative to the F-16’s heading. If the
F-16 were to turn away from the bandit,
                                                      More turning                               Less turning
the aspect angle and angle-off would be              room available                             room available
further reduced, simplifying the targeting
solution for the bandit and granting more
turning room.
If the F-16 turns into the bandit, the
aspect angle and angle-off will be
increased, restricting the turning room
within which the bandit must use. This
                                                                       Turning Room
will complicate the bandit’s targeting
solution and may force the bandit to
overshoot outside the F-16’s turn circle.
Engaged Fighter and Supporting Fighter
During Air Combat Maneuvers (ACM) in which two friendly aircraft are working as a team, one aircraft is
designated as the engaged fighter and the other is designated as the supporting fighter.
•    Engaged Fighter. When maneuvering offensively against a bandit, the engaged fighter is the aircraft that
     is actively maneuvering to employ a weapon. When maneuvering defensively against a bandit, the engaged
     fighter is the aircraft that is being engaged by the bandit.
•    Supporting Fighter. When the engaged fighter is maneuvering offensively against a bandit, the supporting
     fighter maintains a visual on the engaged fighter and tally on the bandit while remaining clear of the fight
     itself but remains ready to employ a weapon against the bandit, if necessary, in coordination with the
     engaged fighter and without endangering the engaged fighter itself. When the engaged fighter is
     maneuvering defensively against a bandit, the supporting fighter employs weapons against the bandit in
     coordination with the engaged fighter and without endangering the engaged fighter itself.
     In addition, the supporting fighter will also need to keep the engaged fighter informed of any other threats
     to the flight (to include other enemy aircraft as well as ground- or naval-based air defense systems) and be
     prepared to direct and cover the engaged fighter’s egress from the fight, if necessary. During close-range
     aerial combat, the engaged fighter will be solely focused on the bandit and reliant on the supporting fighter
     to maintain situational awareness of the battlespace beyond the immediate close-range fight.
It is important to note that any aircraft within the flight may become the engaged fighter, and that in the course
of a close-range WVR engagement the engaged and supporting fighter may change, and may in fact change
more than once. As mentioned above, it is important to develop a plan for how to employ the flight to maneuver,
attack, defend against, and ultimately defeat the bandit. When initiating an attack against an enemy aircraft, the
engaged fighter will typically be the flight lead with the wingman as the supporting fighter. However, when a
bandit is maneuvering against the flight, whether initiating an attack against the flight or if responding to the
flight’s attack against itself, the bandit may choose to engage the supporting fighter. In this instance, the roles
of engaged fighter and supporting fighter will swap.
It is critical that the supporting fighter maneuver to attain positional advantage against the bandit while not
impeding the ability for the engaged fighter to do the same. This can be accomplished by maneuvering within a
different plane of turn, extending from the fight to gain separation, or lagging slightly behind and offset from the
engaged fighter, depending on the positional geometry that would prevent placing oneself in danger of being
engaged by the bandit.



                                                                  Supporting fighter maneuvers
                                                                   into different plane of turn




                                                                    Engaged fighter maneuvers into

                           Supporting fighter offset into separate plane of turn

In the example below, the flight is approaching a merge with a bandit and breaks away from each other in
opposite directions. At this point, the bandit is forced to commit on one or the other, therefore the choice that
the bandit makes will be the determining factor regarding which flight member becomes the engaged fighter or
the supporting fighter. Once the engaged fighter is recognized, the engaged fighter will maneuver to attain
positional advantage against the bandit while the supporting fighter maneuvers to defend the engaged fighter.

Air-to-Surface Missions
Air-to-surface missions can be demanding
missions to undertake. Any successful
strike mission requires detailed planning
to ensure that all the appropriate factors
are considered. In addition, all flight
members must ensure they have a
thorough understanding of the mission
and their respective duties at each phase
of the mission before climbing into the
cockpit.
Mission Objective
The first four factors that should be
considered when planning the mission are
related to the objective of the mission
itself.
     •    The nature of the objective (the targets and the desired weapon effects against them)
     •    The location of the objective (proximity to friendly units, distance from airfield, surrounding terrain)
     •    The timing of the objective (the time at which the desired weapon effects must be achieved)
     •    The on-station time over the objective (the duration of the desired weapon effects, if applicable)
These four factors will determine the selection of munitions that may be used to achieve the desired weapon
effects, the quantity of the given munitions the flight must employ to achieve the desired weapon effects, and
the required amount of fuel the flight must have onboard when committing to the objective. In addition, the time
of day at which the mission is undertaken may further refine what weapons or sensors may be used during the
attack itself.
Enemy Threats
The next set of factors that should be considered are related to the enemy’s ability to prevent the flight from
achieving the mission objective.
     •    Air defense threats surrounding the objective.
     •    Air defense threats that may be encountered while enroute to the objective.
     •    Airborne threats that may be encountered over the objective.
     •    Airborne threats that that may be encountered while enroute to the objective.
                                                                      These four factors will determine the
                                                                      selection of munitions that may be used to
                                                                      defend the flight against such threats while
                                                                      over or enroute to the objective, the quantity

                                                                      ensure their survival, and the configuration
                                                                      of the defensive countermeasures the flight

                                                                      addition, these factors may further dictate
                                                                      the required amount of fuel the flight must
                                                                      have onboard when committing to the
                                                                      objective (for defensive maneuvering) and
                                                                      whether an external ECM pod must be
                                                                      carried.
Terrain and Weather
The third set of factors that should be considered are related to the environment the flight is expecting to
encounter while enroute to or from the objective, as well as at the objective itself.
     •    Terrain surrounding the objective.
     •    Terrain that will be encountered while enroute to the objective.
     •    Weather conditions that are expected over the objective.
     •    Weather conditions that may be encountered while enroute to the objective.
These four factors may limit the selection of munitions that may be successfully employed, or the specific attack
patterns that may be used to employ them. In addition, the terrain may be used to mitigate air defense or
airborne threats that may threaten the flight while enroute to the objective or when conducting the attack itself.
Once a tentative attack plan has been generated that has the highest likelihood of achieving the mission objectives
given the assessed factors, “backwards planning” techniques are used to plan each preceding event leading up
to the strike itself, which will include the ingress strategy and, by extension, the egress strategy. This will ensure
the flight arrives at the mission objective within the required timeline, with the required munitions to achieve the
mission objectives, and sufficient fuel remaining to return to base.


High Altitude Attack Profiles
High altitude attack profiles allow the flight to avoid
most short-range air defense systems such as AAA
or IR-guided weapons such as MANPADS. However,
this will also place the flight within the engagement
range of long-range/high-altitude air defense
systems and increase the probability of detection by
early warning systems or hostile aircraft.
High altitude flight will reduce the workload of flight
members, allowing pilots to maintain a higher
degree of situational awareness and providing more
time to acquire their target prior to weapons
release. Navigation is also simplified when there is
no risk of colliding with terrain, but weather and
visibility may play a more significant factor in target
acquisition.
Fuel consumption when flying at high altitudes will be significantly lower, allowing the flight to increase their
station time over an objective, attack targets at further ranges into enemy territory, or retain additional fuel
reserves for contingencies or defensive maneuvers.
High altitude flight will also provide an advantage when faced with airborne threats, especially if such hostile
aircraft are launched in response to the flight’s approach to the designated target area. In this situation, hostile
aircraft will be at an energy disadvantage while climbing to meet the incoming strike package. Additionally, air-
to-air missiles may be employed at longer ranges against airborne threats.
High Altitude Level Bombing
Performing level-bombing from high-altitude exposes the flight to the least amount of risk over the target area
and is the simplest attack technique to perform. However, this type of attack technique will typically require some
form of precision targeting to increase the likelihood of striking the intended target, which could take the form of
an onboard targeting pod to aid in target acquisition and designation; or an external source of targeting and
designation could be provided (such as another aircraft or ground force in vicinity of the target).
Multiple sensors may be used to acquire the target, such as radar, electro-optical targeting pods, night-vision
goggles, or even visual acquisition using the unaided eye. However, weather and time of day will play an
important factor in determining which sensors are required to find the target.

                                               weapons from level flight               or short-range air defenses




                                        High Altitude Level Bombing

High Altitude Dive Bombing
Dive bombing from high altitudes may expose the flight to additional risk by potentially entering the engagement
ranges of short-range air defenses or by colliding with terrain while pulling off following weapons release.
However, dive bombing increases the accuracy of delivering unguided weapons onto a target by engaging from
a closer range and reduces the dispersion by releasing the weapons from a vertical angle.
Dive bombing may also mitigate the effects of poor visibility over the target area by allowing the flight members
to visually acquire targets below the cloud layers prior to weapons release. But this carries with it the added risk
of colliding with terrain and should only be performed if each flight member has a thorough understanding of the
terrain contours and elevations surrounding the target and has implemented appropriate criteria of when to abort
the attack sequence if visual contact with the surface cannot be achieved.

                                                                                                 Pull off from target to
                                                                                                 avoid weapon effects




                                         High Altitude Dive Bombing
Low Altitude Attack Profiles
Low altitude attack profiles allow the flight to avoid
long-range/high-altitude air defense systems, delay
detection by early warning systems or hostile
aircraft, and minimize the reaction time of short-
range air defenses. However, this will also place the
flight within the engagement range of a greater
number of threat weapon systems.
Such low-altitude flight is more demanding, carries
additional risk, and requires a higher degree of skill
and proficiency to avoid becoming “task saturated”;
especially when performed at night. Situational
awareness is hindered due to the increased time
the flight members spend avoiding terrain and
obstacles instead of scanning outside for threats or
each other, or cross-checking cockpit displays and
sensor information.
Fuel consumption when flying at low altitudes will be significantly higher. Because of this, the time spent at low
altitudes should be minimized to ensure the flight retains enough fuel for egress or defensive maneuvering as
necessary. Performing aerial refueling prior to committing to a low-level strike should be considered, if feasible,
to provide additional options for any contingencies encountered during the mission.
Low altitude flight will also incur a disadvantage when faced with airborne threats, especially if such hostile
aircraft are directed to intercept the flight as they approach the designated target area. In this situation, hostile
aircraft will be at an energy advantage while intercepting the incoming strike package. Additionally, air-to-air
missiles will have reduced ranges against airborne threats.
Low Altitude Level/Retarded Bombing
Performing level-bombing from low-altitude exposes the flight to the most amount of risk over the target area,
exposes the flight to potential damage incurred from their own weapons as well as weapons fire from the enemy,
and will typically require the most accurate intelligence regarding the location of the intended target and its
surroundings. However, this type of attack technique will minimize the time spent within the Weapon Engagement
Zone (WEZ) of enemy air defense systems in vicinity of the target area, does not necessarily require precision
targeting to the same degree as high-altitude bombing, and is unlikely to be impacted by weather over the target
area.
Such attack techniques will typically require some form of deconfliction between each aircraft’s attack sequence
to ensure that the weapon effects from each flight member does not cause damage to their own aircraft. In
addition, munitions with some sort of retarding device may be required in the form of the Mk15 “Snakeye” petals
or the BSU-49 inflatable “ballute” tail kits, to ensure that the delivering aircraft has time to escape the effects of
their own weapons.
                                                             Line up weapon           Retarding devices allow
     Low altitude run-in                                  symbology and release      aircraft to escape weapon
      from Initial Point                                 weapons from level flight     effects prior to impact




                                   Low Altitude Level/Retarded Bombing
Low Altitude Pop-Up Dive Bombing
Pop-up dive bombing from low altitudes allows the flight to take advantage of a low-altitude attack profile while
providing the pilots additional time to acquire the intended target prior to weapons release, reduces the dispersion
of unguided weapons by releasing the weapons from a vertical angle, and also makes the flight pattern
unpredictable when being targeted by short-range air defenses. However, this is the most complex attack
technique to perform and is the most demanding on flight members.
By performing a pop-up from low altitude before reaching the target, pilots will have additional time to acquire
their intended targets prior to weapons release if the precise location or disposition of their targets are unknown;
or if the position quality of their navigation system is in question. But this carries with it the added risk of colliding
with terrain when pulling off following weapons release; and it may momentarily expose the flight to additional
enemy weapon systems in the target area by silhouetting themselves against the sky.

            down to the target area                                       and release weapons
                                                                                                      Pull off from target to
                                                                                                      avoid weapon effects

Standoff Attack Profiles
Using “standoff” to engage targets from longer
range allows the flight to minimize the time spent
within the WEZ of enemy air defense systems, or
allows the flight to avoid the WEZ altogether. This
can be particularly beneficial when attacking
heavily defended targets, or when attempting to
maintain an element of surprise by avoiding
overflight and subsequent detection by nearby
enemy units.
Using standoff attacks will typically be driven by the
available munitions that are in use, which in turn
may be dictated by the nature of the target and the
desired weapon effects, the time of day, or the
weather conditions in vicinity of the target.
Toss Bombing
Toss bombing is an alternative to performing a level bomb delivery and uses the additional kinematics of releasing
a munition while in an ascending flight path to increase the ballistic range that the weapon can achieve following
release from the aircraft. Although toss bombing can be utilized from any altitude, it is more commonly used in
conjunction with a low-altitude pop-up maneuver, except the bomb is released during the pop-up climb itself
rather than during a subsequent dive onto the target.
Unfortunately, toss bombing increases the dispersion of unguided munitions within the target area. Additionally,
when performed from low altitudes, accurate intelligence regarding the location of the intended target and its
surroundings is required if the target is not acquired by the pilot prior to initiating the attack itself. However,
these disadvantages can be mitigated by using precision munitions and external sources of targeting and/or
designation.

Missile/Glide Bomb Delivery
Employing precision munitions such as missiles or glide bombs allows the flight to attack targets from extended
ranges with a high probability of striking the intended target. These munitions may typically be employed from a
variety of altitudes or attack profiles; but the primary limiting factors of these types of munitions are the range
at which the launching aircraft or the munition itself can acquire its target, or the range that the munition can
travel from the point of weapons release.
Employing missiles or glide bombs from high altitudes will improve the ability of the pilot to acquire the target
and will extend the kinematic range from which these weapons may be released. This will allow the launching
aircraft to release the munitions from a greater distance from the target, decreasing the likelihood of the flight
of being engaged by enemy weapon systems surrounding the target. However, this will also increase the chances
of detection by early warning systems and hostile aircraft; and it may place the flight in the WEZ of long-
range/high-altitude air defense systems.
Employing missiles or glide bombs from low altitudes will hinder the ability of the pilot to acquire the target
(depending on the nature of terrain surrounding the target area) and will reduce the kinematic range from which
these weapons may be released. This may force the launching aircraft to release the munitions from a closer
distance to the target, increasing the likelihood of the flight of being engaged by enemy weapon systems in the
target area. However, this will also decrease the chances of detection by early warning systems and hostile
aircraft; and it may allow the flight to avoid the WEZ of long-range/high-altitude air defense systems.

Ingress and Egress Strategies
Planning appropriate ingress and egress routes are just as important as the attack itself. The routes should avoid
known air defenses as much as possible while minimizing the chances of detection for as long as possible. At
times, it may be necessary for the flight to fight their way to and from the target area by engaging enemy threats
along the route to ensure the flight’s survival and ensure the target area can be reached to initiate the attack.
A combination of high and low altitudes may be utilized at different phases of the route as appropriate, along
with terrain masking, ECM jamming, and unpredictable flight patterns to have a collective effect in degrading or
defeating the enemy’s ability to successfully engage the strike package.
In the example below, a strike is planned against a heavily defended target in enemy territory, such as an airfield
or a command center. The initial portion of the ingress begins at high altitude when crossing the FEBA, where
there are likely substantial numbers of tactical ground units equipped with heavy machine guns, light AAA, and
MANPADS. After these units are overflown and the flight approaches the Weapons Engagement Zone (WEZ) of
long-range/high-altitude SAM batteries, the flight descends to low altitude and uses a combination of threat
avoidance, terrain masking, and ECM to avoid engagement. Once the strike is complete, the flight egresses along
a different route and again uses low altitude, threat avoidance, terrain masking, and ECM to avoid an enemy
engagement. When feasible, the flight climbs back to high altitude for the remainder of the flight back to base.

                                                                                                                     High Altitude Flight

                                              Ingress and Egress Planning
The scenario above is just one example; each mission may require various techniques for ingress and egress.
Some missions may need to be flown entirely at low altitude or entirely at high altitude, or a combination of each
as shown above. When threats cannot be avoided or engaged with the flight’s own weapons, it may be necessary
to rely on other flights within a “strike package” for fighter escort or suppression of enemy air defenses.
Pre-Combat Checks
When approaching the combat area, flight members should conduct pre-combat checks and ensure their aircraft
are ready to employ weapons and defensive countermeasures as needed. This is commonly referred to as the
“Fence Check”. Many of the systems may already be appropriately configured during the initial run-up prior to
departure or while enroute, but the final Fence Check allows each pilot to confirm their respective aircraft is ready
for combat.
The Flight Lead may direct each flight member to perform one final Fence Check prior to entering the combat
area using the brevity term “Fence In”. Conversely, the Flight Lead may direct each flight member to perform a
Fence Check after exiting the combat area using the brevity term “Fence Out”.

Flight Formations
U.S. Air Force F-16 squadrons typically consist of 15-24 aircraft. However, tactical missions are commonly
assigned to 4-ship combat formations called “flights”, which consist of two 2-ship fighting units called “elements”.
Each 4-ship flight is commanded by a Flight Lead, with the second element within the flight commanded by a 2-
ship Element Lead. The Flight Lead is responsible for ensuring the success of the flight’s mission and will direct
the actions of the other flight members accordingly.

When approaching the combat area, flight members should conduct pre-combat checks and ensure their aircraft
are ready to employ weapons and defensive countermeasures as needed. Accordingly, wingmen should adjust
their formation and flight patterns to those which are best suited for the tactical situation, routing, and speeds
they intend to fly. In particular, flying in close formation can drastically hinder the collective situational awareness
of the flight if each wingman is solely focused on maintaining a specific formation spacing close to each other,
instead of focusing on their respective cockpit sensors and displays, such as the Fire Control Radar, Threat
Warning Azimuth Indicator, the HARM Attack Display, or the Horizontal Situation Display. In addition, close
formations impede the ability of the flight leader or wingmen to perform immediate combat maneuvers in
response to hostile aircraft or surface-to-air weapons fire; at the risk of a mid-air collision.


Formation Types
Several types of formations may be employed by the Flight Lead, each with a pre-briefed “Close” or “Open”
distance between each flight member. Each formation type has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending
on the tactical situation or maneuvers the flight is undertaking.
Line Abreast
This formation allows the Flight Lead to maximize the firepower of the formation toward the forward sector,
especially when faced with hostile aircraft approaching from the 12 o’clock. This formation also provides mutual
support to flight members if engaged from the sides or from the rear of the formation, while complicating the
ability for the enemy to visually acquire the entire flight.
However, this formation may also complicate the ability of the Flight Lead to rapidly reorient the flight toward a
different direction while maintaining formation. In these instances, it may take time for the flight to regain their
assigned positions following a change in heading, with larger course changes requiring additional time to regain
proper position and spacing.

                                             Line Abreast Formation
Trail
This formation simplifies the ability of the remaining flight members to maneuver relative to the Flight Lead when
operating under night-vision goggles (NVGs) or amongst restrictive terrain during low-level flight. This formation
also provides mutual support to flight members if engaged from the sides of the formation and allows any flight
member to immediately perform defensive maneuvers in response to threats.
However, this formation hinders the ability of the Flight Lead to maximize the firepower of the formation toward
the forward sector while increasing the ability for hostile aircraft to visually acquire the entire flight, especially
when faced with hostile aircraft approaching from the 12 o’clock.

However, this formation may also complicate the ability of
the flight members to respond to threats from the 6

However, this formation may degrade the situational

Spread Four
Similar to the Line Abreast formation, this formation allows the Flight Lead to maximize the firepower of the
formation toward the forward sector, especially when faced with hostile aircraft approaching from the 12 o’clock.
This formation also simplifies the ability of Wingman 2 and 4 to maneuver relative to the Flight Lead and Element
Lead, respectively.
However, like Line Abreast, this formation may complicate the ability of the second element to maintain position
relative to the first element during large course changes. In addition the relative proximity between flight
members may complicate the ability of the flight members to perform defensive maneuvers in response to threats;
as well as increase the ability for hostile aircraft to visually acquire the entire flight.
