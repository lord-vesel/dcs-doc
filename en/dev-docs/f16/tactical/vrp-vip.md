# VISUAL REFERENCE POINT (VRP) & VISUAL INITIAL POINT (VIP) SIGHTING MODES

Although the F-16C is quite capable of performing precision strikes against pre-planned targets designated by a
steerpoint, conducting such attacks following a low-level ingress can be quite challenging in that the target may
not be visible until just prior to weapons release. This is compounded by the possibility that the target itself may
be concealed, camouflaged, or may be difficult to acquire during the final critical moments of a low-level pop-up
maneuver. Two additional sighting modes are available that allow the pilot to use visual landmarks from which
to commence the attack, perform final alignment of the targeting solution just prior to the attack, and utilize
visual cues within the HUD symbology for the location and timing of the pop-up maneuver during the attack itself.




Visual Reference Point (VRP). The steerpoint is used to designate a known target location (TGT). In this
sighting mode, a visually identifiable location is used as a Reference Point (RP), located relative to the TGT, as a
visual cue to the pilot for aligning the aircraft flight path for the attack sequence, ensure the targeting solution is
accurate prior to commencing the attack, or to aid in target acquisition during the attack itself.
A pre-planned Pull-Up Point (PUP), located relative to the TGT, may be employed to provide a visual cue to the
pilot as to when to initiate a pop-up maneuver following the low-level ingress.
Visual Initial Point (VIP). The steerpoint is used to designate a known, visually identifiable location as the
Initial Point (IP) from which to initiate an attack against a target (TGT) that may not be easily seen or detected,
or which the precise location may not be known. In this sighting mode, the pilot may use the steerpoint at the
IP, or offset aimpoints (OA1/OA2) relative to the IP, to ensure the targeting solution is accurate just prior to
commencing the attack.
A pre-planned Pull-Up Point (PUP), located relative to the IP, may be employed to provide a visual cue to the
pilot as to when to initiate a pop-up maneuver following the low-level ingress.
NOTE: VRP and VIP sighting modes may only be simultaneously enabled for separate steerpoints. Each sighting
mode is mutually exclusive; enabling one sighting mode for the same steerpoint will disable the other.
Visual Reference Point (VRP) Sighting Mode
VRP is a sighting mode used in conjunction with “Pre-planned” weapon delivery sub-modes (such as CCRP or
LADD) that provides the pilot with additional visual cues and hands-on designation options for performing level,
toss, or pop-up dive attacks from a low-altitude ingress. A steerpoint is plotted at the target, and a landmark that
is easily identifiable by the pilot while performing low-altitude flight or the pop-up maneuver itself is subsequently
plotted relative to that steerpoint. The pilot may use this visual landmark for aligning the aircraft flight path for
the final attack maneuvers, correcting any misalignments of the HUD symbology before committing to the attack
sequence, or orienting the aircraft relative to the target to aid in target acquisition during the attack itself.

VRP sighting mode is entered when all of the following criteria are met:
      •      The master mode is set to A-G.
      •      The weapon delivery sub-mode is set to CCRP, LADD, EO-PRE, EO-BORE, or PRE.
      •      The TGT steerpoint set on the TGT-TO-VRP DED page is the selected steerpoint.
      •      VRP is enabled on the TGT-TO-VRP DED page.
When VRP sighting mode is entered, the EHSI and Azimuth Steering Line (ASL) will display steering to the Target
(TGT), the sighting point rotary will automatically be set to TGT, and the SOI will automatically move to the HUD.
If the pilot intends to use the RP as a sighting point prior to the attack, RP must be manually selected.
The pilot may correct any misalignments of the HUD symbology using either of the following methods:
      •      Slew the Steerpoint Diamond over the landmark at the RP using the RDR CURSOR/ENABLE switch with
             the HUD, FCR, or TGP as SOI.
      •      Designate the RP using TMS Forward with the HUD as SOI while performing a direct overflight of the
             landmark itself. When TMS Forward is pressed, the sighting point rotary will sequence to TGT.
Regardless of which method the pilot uses to align the HUD symbology, any misalignments of the HUD symbology
as a result of the system navigation solution will be effectively corrected. This will ensure the Target Designator
(TD) Box will be placed over the corresponding target location and the weapon release symbology will be
accurately calculated to the target location during the final moments of the attack sequence; assuming the
Reference Point location has been accurately plotted on the TGT-TO-VRP DED page.
In the figure below and on the previous page, attack geometry has been pre-planned with the Reference Point
input via the TGT-TO-VRP DED page, and an optional Pull-Up Point has been input via the TGT-TO-PUP DED
page. The PUP is a location from where a pop-up diving attack is initiated from low altitude. Pull-Up Points must
be plotted at a location that provides sufficient maneuver space and time for the pilot to perform the pop-up
maneuver, roll over for a subsequent “pull-down” maneuver, visually acquire the target, align the aircraft for
weapons release, and then perform a safe-escape maneuver prior to reaching minimum safe altitude.

circle will be displayed within the HUD at the corresponding location. If the circle is outside of the HUD field-of-
view, the circle will be displayed along the edge of the HUD symbology and will be overlayed with an ×.

Visual Initial Point (VIP) Sighting Mode
VIP is a sighting mode used in conjunction with “Pre-planned” weapon delivery sub-modes (such as CCRP or
LADD) that provides the pilot with additional visual cues and hands-on designation options for performing level,
toss, or pop-up dive attacks from a low-altitude ingress. A steerpoint is plotted at a landmark that is easily
identifiable by the pilot while performing low-altitude flight, and a target location is subsequently plotted relative
to that steerpoint. The pilot may use this visual landmark to align the aircraft flight path for the final attack
maneuvers or to correct any misalignments of the HUD symbology before committing to the attack sequence.

VIP sighting mode is entered when all of the following criteria are met:
      •        The master mode is set to A-G.
      •        The weapon delivery sub-mode is set to CCRP, LADD, EO-PRE, EO-BORE, or PRE.
      •        The VIP steerpoint set on the VIP-TO-TGT DED page is the selected steerpoint.
      •        VIP mode is enabled on the VIP-TO-TGT DED page.
When VIP sighting mode is entered, the EHSI will display steering to the Initial Point (IP), the Azimuth Steering
Line will display steering to the Target (TGT), the sighting point rotary will automatically be set to IP, and the
SOI will automatically move to the HUD.
The pilot may correct any misalignments of the HUD symbology by designating the IP using TMS Forward with
the HUD as SOI while performing a direct overflight of the landmark itself. When TMS Forward is pressed, the
EHSI steering will switch to the Target (TGT), the sighting point rotary will sequence to TGT, and the SOI will
automatically move to the FCR MFD format (if displayed).
When the IP location is accurately designated during overflight, any misalignments of the HUD symbology as a
result of the system navigation solution will be effectively corrected. This will ensure the Target Designator (TD)
Box will be placed over the corresponding target location and the weapon release symbology will be accurately
calculated to the target location during the final moments of the attack sequence; assuming the Target location
has been accurately plotted on the VIP-TO-TGT DED page.
In the figures above and on the following page, attack geometry has been pre-planned with the Target input via
the VIP-TO-TGT DED page, and an optional Pull-Up Point has been input via the VIP-TO-PUP DED page.
The PUP is a location from where a pop-up diving attack is initiated from low altitude. Pull-Up Points must be
plotted at a location that provides sufficient maneuver space and time for the pilot to perform the pop-up
maneuver, roll over for a subsequent “pull-down” maneuver, visually acquire the target, align the aircraft for
weapons release, and then perform a safe-escape maneuver prior to reaching minimum safe altitude.

be displayed within the HUD at the corresponding location of the Pull-Up Point. If the circle is outside of the HUD
field-of-view, the circle will be displayed along the edge of the HUD symbology and will be overlayed with an ×.

If the selected steerpoint or master mode is changed, any cursor slews that have been accumulated by the VIP
cursor will be retained. Upon returning to VIP sighting mode, an overfly designation of the IP may be performed,
if necessary, regardless of whether an overfly designation had been performed prior to exiting VIP mode.
If VIP mode is disabled and then re-enabled on the VIP-TO-TGT DED page, any cursor slews that have been
accumulated by the VIP cursor will be zeroed and VIP sighting mode will be reset to a pre-designate state.

1.   PUP Mode Select. Enables/disables display of the PUP symbol by placing the DED asterisks around the
     data field and pressing the 0/M-SEL button on the ICP keypad, which will highlight the text within the data
     field when PUP is enabled.
2.   VIP Steerpoint. Displays the steerpoint used as the Initial Point (IP) when VIP mode is entered. The ICP
     Increment/Decrement rocker may be used to cycle to a different steerpoint, or the DED asterisks may be
     placed over the data field and a steerpoint number may be input using the ICP keypad followed by ENTR.
     NOTE: VIP sighting cannot be simultaneously enabled for the same steerpoint as VRP. If a steerpoint is set
     as the VIP steerpoint and as the TGT steerpoint, pressing 0/M-SEL to enable VIP will disable VRP.
3.   True Bearing from VIP (TBRG). Displays the relative bearing (in degrees true) of the PUP from the VIP
     steerpoint. May be modified by placing the DED asterisks over the data field, inputting a value using the ICP
     keypad, and pressing ENTR.
4.   Range from VIP (RNG). Displays the range (in nautical miles) of the PUP from the VIP steerpoint. May
     be modified by placing the DED asterisks over the data field, inputting a value using the ICP keypad, and
     pressing ENTR.
5.   Elevation difference from VIP (ELEV). Displays the difference in elevation (in feet) of the PUP from the
     VIP steerpoint. May be modified by placing the DED asterisks over the data field, inputting a value using the
     ICP keypad, and pressing ENTR. To enter a negative value, press 0/M-SEL to enter a leading zero, which
     will be input as a negative (–) symbol, followed by the numerical elevation difference value.
6.   DED Asterisks. If a data field on the DED is bracketed by these symbols, the ICP keypad may be used to
     enter a different value, or the 0/M-SEL button may be used to enable it in some cases. A data field that has
     been modified but has not been accepted will be highlighted. When the modified data is accepted (ICP ENTR
     button) or rejected (ICP RCL button) the data field will be returned to normal, de-highlighted text.
Designating the IP using Direct Overflight
If the IP is selected as the sighting point and the HUD is SOI, a direct overflight and designation of the IP may
be used to simultaneously align the HUD symbology for the attack, update EHSI steering to the target (TGT),
sequence the sighting point rotary to TGT, and move the SOI to the FCR MFD format.
To perform an overfly designation of the IP,
ensure VIP has been enabled on the VIP-TO-         7. Sub-mode (OSB 2)                    6. Weapon (OSB 6)

     if necessary.
9.   Visually acquire the physical landmark
     that corresponds with the Initial Point
     (IP) location.
10. Maneuver the aircraft as necessary to
    align the Flight Path Marker (FPM) for a        9. IP location is
    direct overflight of the IP location.           visually acquired

11. TMS Forward-Short – Press when directly
    over the landmark at the IP location.
When TMS Forward-Short is pressed, the VIP
cursor will be immediately slewed to place the
IP steerpoint directly below the aircraft, which
will slew the Target (TGT), Pull-Up Point
(PUP), and offset aimpoints (OA1/OA2) an
equal distance and direction to align the HUD
symbology for the attack.
