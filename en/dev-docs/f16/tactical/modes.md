# MASTER MODES

The F-16C’s sensors, avionics, and fire control configurations are managed through the use of pilot-selectable
master modes. There are seven master modes in total, with multiple weapon delivery sub-modes to accommodate
various methods of targeting, designation, and weapons employment.
When the pilot switches from one master mode to another, avionics settings and MFD states are retained within
the previous master mode. This allows the pilot to configure specific avionics settings for each master mode prior
to the mission for efficient cockpit management when in the mission area; or to return to a previous task if forced
to switch to a different master mode abruptly. This can be especially useful if engaged by hostile fighters during
a strike mission, in which case the pilot would need to rapidly re-configure the FCR, SMS weapon profile, and
MFDs for aerial combat. In the F-16C, this can be accomplished with a push of a button or thumb press of a
switch on the throttle, allowing the pilot to immediately respond to changes in the tactical situation as they occur.

                                      Master Mode Selection Hierarchy
The three primary master modes are Navigation (NAV), Air-to-Air Missile (AAM), and Air-to-Ground (A-G), which
are accessed using the A-A and A-G master mode buttons on the Integrated Control Panel (ICP). Two secondary
master modes are Dogfight (DGFT) and Missile Override (MSL), which are accessed using the DOG FIGHT switch
on the throttle grip. (See Hands-On Controls for more information.)
Two additional modes are Selective Jettison (S-J) and Emergency Jettison (E-J). The former may be entered from
NAV, AAM, or A-G master modes by accessing the SMS Selective Jettison (S-J) page. The latter is entered when
the Emergency Jettison button on the Left Auxiliary Console is pressed and held.
Navigation (NAV) Master Mode
Navigation mode is the default master mode that is entered when the avionics are initialized. NAV mode is used
for takeoff, landing, navigation, and when performing navigation position updates. “NAV” is displayed in the HUD
Master Mode Status.
When Navigation master mode is entered, the following changes will take effect:
     •     The FCR will default to CRM mode but may be changed to any air-to-air or air-to-ground mode.
     •     The HUD will display navigation-related symbology only.
     •     “NAV” will be displayed in the HUD Master Mode Status.
     •     MFD formats and format selections will be displayed as last set for Navigation mode.
The TGP and HTS pods may be used while
in NAV mode (to include firing the laser
rangefinder/designator or designating
radar threats on the HAD MFD format), but
weapons employment will not be possible.
The default MFD formats for each MFD
when the aircraft is set to Navigation mode
are shown to the right. However, these
may be changed at any time during the
mission and will be retained during master
mode switchovers.


Air-to-Air Missile (AAM) Mode
Air-to-Air Missile mode is used for aerial combat and employing air-to-air guided missiles and the 20mm rotary
cannon against enemy aircraft. AAM mode is entered by pressing the A-A master mode button on the ICP if the
master mode is set to either NAV or A-G mode. Pressing the A-A master mode button when already in AAM will
set the master mode to NAV.
When Air-to-Air Missile master mode is entered, the following changes will take effect:
     •     The FCR will default to CRM mode but may be changed to any other air-to-air mode.
     •     The HUD will display missile-related symbology, based on the selected missile type.
     •     “MRM”, “SRM”, or “HOB” will be displayed in the HUD Master Mode Status, depending on which missile
           type was last selected in AAM mode, along with the missile quantity of that type. If no air-to-air missiles
           are loaded, “AAM” is displayed in the HUD Master Mode Status.
     •     If the Master Arm switch is set to ARM, AIM-9 seekers on any air-to-air missile stations will be cooled.
     •     MFD formats and format selections will be displayed as last set for Air-to-Air Missile mode.
Note that a specific missile type may be set
on the SMS for each air-to-air master mode
(AAM, MSL, or DGFT). By simply switching
between these modes, a different missile
type will be automatically selected.
The default MFD formats for each MFD
when the aircraft is set to Air-to-Air Missile
mode are shown to the right. However,
these may be changed at any time during
the mission and will be retained during
master mode switchovers.
Air-to-Ground (A-G) Master Mode
Air-to-Ground mode is used for delivering munitions against ground targets. A-G mode is entered by pressing the
A-G master mode button on the ICP if the master mode is set to either NAV or A-A mode. Pressing the A-G master
mode button when already in A-G will set the master mode to NAV.
When Air-to-Ground master mode is entered, the following changes will take effect:
     •    If a “Pre-planned” weapon delivery sub-mode is entered, the FCR will default to GM but may be changed
          to GMT or SEA modes. If a “Visual” weapon delivery sub-mode is entered, the FCR will enter AGR mode
          and cannot be changed.
     •    The HUD will display weapon delivery symbology, based on the SMS weapon profile and the selected
          weapon delivery sub-mode, which will be displayed in the HUD Master Mode Status.
     •    MFD formats and format selections will be displayed as last set for Air-to-Ground master mode.
The default MFD formats for each MFD
when the aircraft is set to Air-to-Ground
master mode are shown to the right.
However, these may be changed at any
time during the mission and will be
retained during master mode switchovers.




Missile Override (MSL) Mode
Missile Override mode is used to rapidly configure the aircraft for aerial combat directly from the flight controls
by moving the DOG FIGHT switch to the inboard position on the throttle. Missile Override mode will take
precedence over the previous master mode, with the exception of Emergency Jettison. Returning the DOG FIGHT
switch to the center position will return to the previous master mode prior to entering Missile Override.
When Missile Override master mode is entered, the following changes will take effect:
     •    The FCR will default to CRM mode but may be changed to any air-to-air mode.
     •    The HUD will display missile-related symbology, based on the selected missile type.
     •    “MRM”, “SRM”, or “HOB” will be displayed in the HUD Master Mode Status, depending on which missile
          type was last selected in Missile Override mode, along with the missile quantity of that type.
     •    If the Master Arm switch is set to ARM, AIM-9 seekers on any air-to-air missile stations will be cooled.
     •    MFD formats and format selections will be displayed as last set for Missile Override mode.
Note that a specific missile type may be set
on the SMS for each air-to-air master mode
(AAM, MSL, or DGFT). By simply switching
between these modes, a different missile
type will be automatically selected.
The default MFD formats for each MFD
when the aircraft is set to Missile Override
mode are shown to the right. However,
these may be changed at any time during
the mission and will be retained during
master mode switchovers.
Dogfight (DGFT) Mode
Dogfight mode is used to rapidly configure the aircraft for aerial combat directly from the flight controls by moving
the DOG FIGHT switch to the outboard position on the throttle. Dogfight mode will take precedence over the
previous master mode, with the exception of Emergency Jettison. Returning the DOG FIGHT switch to the center
position will return to the previous master mode prior to entering Dogfight.
When Dogfight master mode is entered, the following changes will take effect:
     •     The FCR will default to ACM mode but may be changed to any air-to-air mode.
     •     The M61 20mm rotary cannon will be enabled in EEGS sub-mode.
     •     The HUD will be decluttered and optimized for close-range aerial combat maneuvers, EEGS-related
           symbology will be displayed, and the Velocity Scale will automatically revert to calibrated airspeed
           (CAS) regardless of the Velocity switch position on the HUD Control Panel.
     •     “DGFT” will be displayed in the HUD Master Mode Status
     •     If the Master Arm switch is set to ARM, AIM-9 seekers on any air-to-air missile stations will be cooled.
     •     MFD formats and format selections will be displayed as last set for Dogfight mode.
Note that a specific missile type may be set
on the SMS for each air-to-air master mode
(AAM, MSL, or DGFT). By simply switching
between these modes, a different missile
type will be automatically selected.
The default MFD formats for each MFD
when the aircraft is set to Dogfight mode
are shown to the right. However, these
may be changed at any time during the
mission and will be retained during master
mode switchovers.


Selective Jettison (JETT) Mode
Selective Jettison mode is used to jettison individual weapons and/or weapon stations from the underwing pylons
without arming the weapons themselves. Selective Jettison mode is entered by pressing OSB 11 on the SMS MFD
format. Pressing OSB 11 when already in S-J mode will set the master mode back to the previous selection.
The default MFD formats for each MFD
when the aircraft is set to Selective Jettison
mode are shown to the right. However,
these may be changed at any time during
the mission and will be retained during
master mode switchovers.
Emergency Jettison (JETT) Mode
Emergency Jettison mode is used to jettison all weapons (except for air-to-air missiles) and fuel tanks from
underwing stations 3 through 7. Emergency Jettison mode is entered by pressing and holding the Emergency
Jettison button on the Left Auxiliary Console, which will override all other master modes. Releasing the Emergency
Jettison button will set the master mode back to the previous selection.
The default MFD formats for each MFD
when the aircraft is set to Emergency
Jettison mode are shown to the right.




Cycling MFD Formats using the Side Stick Controller
Each MFD is assigned three formats for each master mode. These formats can be selected for display by pressing
the corresponding Format Select OSB below the format label. The assigned format for each Format Select button
can be re-assigned at any time during the mission. (See Multi-Function Displays for more information.)
The MFD format can also be cycled using the Display Management Switch
(DMS) on the Side Stick Controller (SSC), allowing the pilot to seamlessly
select a different MFD format while maintaining hands on the flight
controls. This can be especially useful during high-G maneuvers that might
preclude reaching out to an MFD to press the OSB directly, or when
needing to quickly assign the Sensor-Of-Interest to an MFD format that is
not current displayed. See Sensor-Of-Interest (SOI) on the following page      Display Management
                                                                                  Switch (4-way)
for more information.
When the DMS switch is pressed left or right, the corresponding MFD will
cycle to the next assigned format in an outwards fashion. If one of the
Format Select buttons have been assigned to the BLANK MFD format, that
button will be skipped in the sequence, and will simply toggle between the
two remaining formats. If two of the Format Select buttons have been
assigned to the BLANK MFD format, DMS will have no effect on that MFD.
