# WEAPON DELIVERY SUB-MODES

When conducting attacks against ground targets, a variety of weapon delivery sub-modes may be utilized by the
pilot. The weapon delivery sub-modes that are available for selection may depend on the selected weapon, and
whether the target is located at a known location designated by a steerpoint or acquired during the mission using
onboard sensors or the pilot’s eyesight. As such, these air-to-ground weapon delivery sub-modes are delineated
into two categories: “Pre-planned” sub-modes and “Visual” sub-modes.




“Pre-planned” Weapon Delivery Sub-modes                         “Visual” Weapon Delivery Sub-modes
Target location is designated by a steerpoint.                  Target is visually acquired by the pilot.
•    CCRP Continuously-Computed Release Point                   •    CCIP Continuously-Computed Impact Point
•    LADD Low Altitude Drogue Delivery                          •    DTOS Dive/Toss
•    EO-PRE Electro-Optical Pre-planned                         •    STRF Strafe
•    EO-BORE Electro-Optical Boresight                          •    EO-VIS Electro-Optical Visual
•    PRE Pre-planned                                            •    VIS Visual
•    HARM High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile
•    HTS HARM Targeting System
Each category of weapon delivery sub-modes differs in how the target is designated and what type of weapon
employment symbology cues are provided to the pilot. However, the pilot retains the ability to dynamically change
between weapon delivery sub-modes using the Hands-On Controls at any time, even during an attack itself.
As an example, while performing a low-altitude ingress toward a target, the pilot may utilize CCRP to receive
steering toward a pre-planned steerpoint located at the expected position of the target itself. Just prior to arriving
at the steerpoint, the pilot performs a rapid climb to gain altitude over the target area in order to visually confirm
the target location prior to weapon release. When the target is sighted, the pilot notes that the target location is
several hundred meters from the steerpoint symbol within the HUD, which may be due to accumulated errors
within the navigation system during the flight, inaccurate intelligence regarding the target location, or (if the
target is mobile) the target may have simply moved. The pilot presses the MSL STEP button on the side stick to
immediately switch to CCIP or DTOS and visually attack the target independently of the pre-planned steerpoint.
“Pre-planned” Weapon Delivery Sub-modes
Attacks against pre-planned targets are facilitated by setting a steerpoint at the location of the intended target.
This target steerpoint is used by the avionics to direct the pilot to the target location, perform weapon delivery
calculations, and to generate targeting symbology for the pilot during the attack sequence itself. To that end, the
navigation solution of the aircraft must be accurate enough to ensure the weapon delivery calculations and the
corresponding targeting symbology reflect the true location of the target up to the point of weapons release.
(See the Air-to-Ground Employment chapter for more information regarding each weapon delivery sub-mode.)


Sighting Points and Cursor Corrections
Various methods may be used update the navigation solution to mitigate accumulated errors and regain the
accuracy needed to reliably navigate across long distances and deliver munitions onto the intended target.
However, if it is not feasible to perform a navigation update, which may be the case just prior to arriving over
the intended target or if performing low-level flight in an area devoid of any useable landmarks, or if a small
aiming correction is required to ensure weapon release calculations are accurate, a temporary correction may be
applied by “slewing” the Navigation cursor. In this case, a navigation update is not performed, but navigation
steering and weapon release calculations are adjusted to account for small inaccuracies in the system navigation
solution. (See Navigation Updates in the Navigation chapter for more information.)
Since any drift within the navigation solution will affect the accuracy of the target steerpoint relative to the target’s
physical location, and therefore the accuracy of the weapon release calculations and corresponding symbology,
the pilot may utilize “sighting points” for confirming or correcting the alignment of the weapon delivery symbology
over the target. Sighting points typically consist of steerpoints and their corresponding offset aimpoints (if used).
If the selected sighting point is not aligned with the physical location to which the sighting point corresponds,
corrections may be made using the RDR CURSOR/ENABLE switch on the throttle. When such adjustments are
performed, the pilot is using a “cursor slew” rather than performing an actual update to the navigation system.

                                                                               Railroad crossing




                          Cursor slew correction using “direct sighting” through the HUD

It is important to note that since the navigation system is not receiving a position update, the system navigation
solution will not change with the cursor slew. Rather, the pilot is applying a manual adjustment to the Navigation
cursor so that the Steerpoint Diamond within the HUD symbology aligns with the corresponding location or
landmark seen outside the cockpit. As the pilot proceeds on the planned route through subsequent steerpoints,
the cursor slew is retained so that all steerpoints receive the same corrections at once.
In the event such landmarks cannot be visually acquired by the pilot, as in the case of low-light conditions,
adverse weather, or it is simply too far to be seen, the FCR or TGP may be used to perform the same corrections.
However, just as is the case where the pilot must see landmarks to perform a cursor slew using the HUD
symbology as a reference, the sighting point location must be detectable by the FCR to the extent it can be
distinguished amongst the ground clutter, or recognizable within the TGP’s optical sensors.
In such cases where a “direct sighting” of the steerpoint location cannot be performed, “offset aimpoint sighting”
may be used with objects in the vicinity of the steerpoint that are easily recognizable through the HUD or within
the TGP’s optical sensors, or radar-detectable by the FCR in Ground Map (GM) mode. As the pilot visually acquires
the physical landmark that corresponds with the offset aimpoint, a cursor slew may be applied to the Navigation
cursor to align the Offset Aimpoint Triangle within the HUD symbology over the offset aimpoint location.
Alternatively, if using the TGP to acquire the offset aimpoint, the pilot simply slews the TGP crosshairs over the
offset aimpoint location to perform the intended correction.

                                                                                                          HUD TD Box
                                                                        FCR Crosshairs




              Cursor slew correction using “offset aimpoint sighting” through the HUD or FCR

If using the FCR in GM mode, the radar-detectable object corresponding with the sighting point is acquired on
the FCR MFD format. If the FCR crosshairs are not located at the intended sighting point as the pilot studies the
ground radar map, the RDR CURSOR/ENABLE switch is used to slew the crosshairs onto the sighting point in the
same manner as slewing the TGP crosshairs.
Prior to performing any cursor slew corrections, the pilot must select the intended sighting point with which to
use as a reference. The current sighting point is displayed adjacent to OSB 10 on the FCR and TGP MFD
formats and may be sequenced using the sighting point rotary button (OSB 10). Once the intended sighting
point is selected, the pilot may perform cursor corrections as needed until the HUD symbology or sensor is
aligned with the corresponding sighting point.
The F-16 also includes several specialized sighting modes that may be used in conjunction with “Pre-planned”
weapon delivery sub-modes.
     •      Visual Reference Point and Visual Initial Point sighting modes allow the pilot to perform last minute
            corrections to the alignment of the HUD symbology with regard to expected target location, typically
            prior to commencing a low-level ingress to a pop-up attack maneuver.
     •      Snowplow sighting mode allows the pilot to rapidly reposition the SPI directly in front of the aircraft.
            Snowplow may also be used in Navigation master mode if the FCR is set to GM, GMT, or SEA modes.
Sighting Point Options
Sighting points may only be utilized when employing “Pre-planned” weapon delivery sub-modes. However, some
sighting point options are limited to specific steerpoint ranges or are only available in VIP or VRP modes.
The pilot may select a different sighting point by pressing the sighting point rotary at OSB 10 on the FCR format
when the FCR is set to GM, GMT, or SEA modes, or on the TGP format. Each time the sighting point rotary is
pressed, the selection will advance to the next available sighting point within the list in a cyclic fashion, eventually
returning to the first selection.




                                        Sighting Point Rotary (OSB 10)

The pilot may also use TMS Right-Short when the SOI is set to HUD or FCR to advance to the next sighting point.
Steerpoint/Target (STP/TGT)
The selected steerpoint is used in a “direct sighting” method, where the physical location or target that
corresponds with the steerpoint is identified by the aircraft sensors or visually by the pilot through the HUD/HMCS.
The cursor is slewed as necessary until the Steerpoint Diamond or Target Designator (TD) Box is directly over
the physical steerpoint location or target to provide accurate navigation alignment or steering to the weapon
release point.
        STP. The steerpoint is used as a location reference and is represented by the Steerpoint Diamond within
        the HUD and HMCS symbology, under any of the following conditions.
        •     Master mode is set to NAV.
        •     Master mode is set to A-G and the weapon delivery sub-mode is set to MAN (Manual bombing).
        •     Master mode is set to A-G, the selected weapon profile on the SMS page is set to AG88 (AGM-88
              HARM missiles), and the HARM mode is set to HAS (HARM-As-Sensor).
        TGT. The steerpoint is used as a target and is represented by the Target Designator (TD) Box within the
        HUD and HMCS symbology, under any of the following conditions.
        •     Master mode is set to A-G and the weapon delivery sub-mode is set to CCRP, LADD, EO-PRE, EO-
              BORE, or PRE.
        •     Master mode is set to A-G, the selected weapon profile on the SMS page is set to AG88 (AGM-88
              HARM missiles), and the HARM mode is set to POS (Position Known).
Offset Aimpoint (OA1/OA2)
A known location near the steerpoint is used in an “offset aimpoint sighting” method, where a distinct landmark
that is easily identified by the aircraft sensors or recognizable by the pilot through the HUD/HMCS is calculated
to be at a precise range and bearing from the steerpoint. An Offset Aimpoint Triangle symbol is displayed at the
calculated range and bearing relative to the Steerpoint Diamond or Target Designator (TD) Box.
The cursor is slewed as necessary until the Offset Aimpoint Triangle is directly over the physical landmark that
corresponds with the offset aimpoint location, which will in turn ensure the Steerpoint Diamond or TD Box is
directly over the physical steerpoint location or target to provide accurate navigation alignment or steering to the
weapon release point.
       OA1/OA2. The offset aimpoint is used as a location reference and is represented by the Offset Aimpoint
       Triangle when the corresponding sighting point is selected, under any of the following conditions.
        •     Master mode is set to NAV, S-J, or E-J.
        •     Master mode is set to A-G and the weapon delivery sub-mode is set to CCRP, LADD, EO-PRE, EO-
              BORE, PRE, or MAN (Manual bombing).
        •     Master mode is set to A-G, the selected weapon profile on the SMS page is set to AG88 (AGM-88
              HARM missiles), and the HARM mode is set to HAS (HARM-As-Sensor) or POS (Position Known).
       OA1/OA2 are only available as sighting points for steerpoints 1-25, and only under the following conditions.
        •     FIX, A-CAL, and Snowplow (SP) are not selected.
        •     The offset aimpoint range from the steerpoint has been programmed with a value greater than “0”.
Initial Point (IP)
The selected steerpoint is a known location used as an initial point that is visually recognizable by the pilot through
the HUD/HMCS during a low-level attack against a target that is calculated to be at a precise range and bearing
from the steerpoint. The steerpoint is used as the IP when in Visual Initial Point (VIP) mode.
The cursor is slewed as necessary until the Steerpoint Diamond is directly over the physical steerpoint location,
or the IP is overflown and designated by TMS Forward, which will in turn ensure the Target Designator (TD) Box
is directly over the physical target to provide accurate steering to the weapon release point.
        IP. The steerpoint is used as an initial point and is represented by the Steerpoint Diamond within the
        HUD and HMCS symbology, under the following conditions.
        •     Master mode is set to A-G, the weapon delivery sub-mode is set to CCRP, LADD, EO-PRE, EO-BORE,
              PRE, or MAN, and VIP mode is enabled for the selected steerpoint.
NOTE: If the selected steerpoint is changed to a different steerpoint than that entered on the VIP-TO-TGT DED
page, the Initial Point sighting point option will be removed.
Reference Point (RP)
The selected steerpoint is a known location used as a target during a low-level attack and a distinct landmark
that is visually recognizable by the pilot through the HUD/HMCS is calculated to be at a precise range and bearing
from the steerpoint. The landmark is used as the RP when in Visual Reference Point (VRP) mode.
The cursor is slewed as necessary until the Steerpoint Diamond is directly over the physical landmark that
corresponds with the reference point location, or the RP is overflown and designated by TMS Forward, which will
in turn ensure the Target Designator (TD) Box is directly over the physical target to provide accurate steering to
the weapon release point.
        RP. The reference point is used as a visual reference and is represented by the Steerpoint Diamond within
        the HUD and HMCS symbology, under the following conditions.
        •     Master mode is set to A-G, the weapon delivery sub-mode is set to CCRP, LADD, EO-PRE, EO-BORE,
              PRE, or MAN, and VRP mode is enabled for the selected steerpoint.
NOTE: If the selected steerpoint is changed to a different steerpoint than that entered on the TGT-TO-VRP DED
page, the Reference Point sighting point option will be removed.
Cursor Slewing
Any time the pilot performs a “cursor slew” in which corrections or adjustments are being made to the steerpoint
location, the TD Box, or the HUD Mark Cue, the pilot is affecting one of 7 independent cursors. Only one cursor
may be controlled by the pilot (using the RDR CURSOR/ENABLE switch on the throttle grip) at any given time.
The cursor that is controlled by the pilot is dependent on the current master mode, weapon delivery sub-mode,
and Sensor-Of-Interest (SOI).
After a cursor has been slewed, the accumulated slew inputs are retained for that cursor independently of the
others through changes of the master mode or weapon delivery sub-mode. As an example, if the Navigation
cursor had not been slewed prior to entering VIP mode, but the VIP cursor was subsequently slewed as the pilot
approached the IP during a low-level attack, the Navigation cursor would remain unaffected with no slews applied.
In addition, if the selected steerpoint is changed while any aircraft sensor is tracking a ground target, the sensor
will break track to prevent excessive cursor slews from being applied from the newly selected steerpoint. This
will cause the FCR to break track if set to GM, GMT, or SEA modes, the TGP to break track if in A-G mode, or any
designated radar emitter on the HAD MFD format to be undesignated.
Navigation Cursor
The Navigation cursor applies navigation corrections to all steerpoints at the same time without changing the
system navigation solution or performing an update to the INS itself. (See Sighting Points and Cursor Corrections
for more information.)
The Navigation cursor may be slewed when the FCR or TGP are set as SOI under any of the following conditions.
     •    Master mode is set to NAV, S-J, or E-J.
     •    Master mode is set to A-G and the weapon delivery sub-mode is set to CCRP, LADD, EO-PRE, EO-BORE,
          PRE, or MAN (Manual bombing).
     •    Master mode is set to A-G, the selected weapon profile on the SMS page is set to AG88 (AGM-88 HARM
          missiles), and the HARM mode is set to HAS (HARM-As-Sensor) or POS (Position Known).
VIP & VRP Cursors
The VIP and VRP cursors apply navigation corrections to the selected steerpoint when in VIP or VRP modes,
respectively, without affecting the Navigation cursor or changing the navigation solution or performing an update
to the INS itself. (See Visual Reference Point (VRP) & Visual Initial Point (VIP) for more information.)
The VIP cursor may be slewed when the HUD, FCR, or TGP are set as SOI under the following conditions.
     •    Master mode is set to A-G, Visual Initial Point (VIP) mode is enabled for the selected steerpoint, and
          the weapon delivery sub-mode is set to CCRP, LADD, EO-PRE, EO-BORE, PRE, or MAN.
The VRP cursor may be slewed when the HUD, FCR, or TGP are set as SOI under the following conditions.
     •    Master mode is set to A-G, Visual Reference Point (VRP) mode is enabled for the selected steerpoint,
          and the weapon delivery sub-mode is set to CCRP, LADD, EO-PRE, EO-BORE, PRE, or MAN.
Markpoint Cursor
The Markpoint cursor applies movement to the HUD Mark Cue within the HUD symbology when using the HUD
method to create a markpoint. (See DED MARK page in The F-16C Viper chapter for more information.)
The Markpoint cursor may be slewed when the HUD is SOI under the following conditions.
     •    The MARK DED page is displayed the Mark method has been set to “HUD”.
HMCS Cursor
The HMCS cursor applies movement to the TD Box or the HUD Mark Cue within the HMCS symbology. (See DED
MARK page in the F-16C Viper chapter for more information.)
The HMCS cursor may be slewed when the HMCS is SOI under any of the following conditions.
     •    Master mode is set to A-G and the weapon delivery sub-mode is set to DTOS, EO-VIS, or VIS.
     •    The MARK DED page is displayed the Mark method has been set to “HUD”.
Visual Cursor
The Visual cursor applies movement to the Target Designator (TD) Box within the HUD symbology when
performing air-to-ground targeting against targets that are visually identified by the pilot through the canopy or
the targeting pod sensor video, independently of pre-planned steerpoints. (See “Visual” Weapon Delivery Sub-
modes for more information.)
The Visual cursor may be slewed when the HUD or TGP are SOI under the following conditions.
     •    Master mode is set to A-G and the weapon delivery sub-mode is set to DTOS, EO-VIS, or VIS.
Snowplow Cursor
The Snowplow cursor is located at a fixed range in front of the aircraft and is used to direct the aircraft sensors
forward of the aircraft’s flight path. The Snowplow cursor itself cannot be slewed by the pilot, but its position
relative to the aircraft may be modified. See Snowplow Sighting Method on the following page for more
information.


Cursor Zero (CZ)
Cursor slews may be removed entirely by pressing the
Cursor Zero (CZ) button, which is displayed at OSB 9 on
the FCR or TGP MFD formats, or OSB 10 on the HSD MFD
format.
     •    If the Navigation cursor, VIP cursor, or VRP
          cursor have accumulated any cursor slews, the
          CZ OSB option will be displayed on the
          relevant MFD formats to indicate that cursor
          corrections have been input into the system.
     •    If the Navigation cursor, VIP cursor, or VRP
          cursor cursors have not accumulated any
          cursor slews, or the cursor slews are removed
          using Cursor Zero, the CZ OSB option will be
          removed and not displayed on the relevant
          MFD formats.
     •    The CZ OSB option will only zeroize the
          accumulated slews of the cursor that is
          currently being controlled by the pilot.
As an example, if the Navigation cursor was slewed prior to entering VIP mode, and the VIP cursor was
subsequently slewed as the pilot approached the IP; if the pilot were to press the CZ OSB option, the VIP cursor
would be zeroized but the Navigation cursor would remain unaffected. In this situation, if the Navigation cursor
was intended to be zeroized, the pilot would need to exit VIP mode and return to a master mode and/or weapon
delivery sub-mode in which the Navigation cursor is affected and then press the CZ OSB option.
     •    Zeroizing the Navigation cursor removes cursor slews from all steerpoints.
     •    Zeroizing the VIP cursor while in VIP mode removes cursor slews from the selected VIP steerpoint.
     •    Zeroizing the VRP cursor while in VRP mode removes cursor slews from the selected VRP steerpoint.
Hands-On Cursor Zero
If a targeting pod is installed, powered, and operational, Cursor Zero may be alternatively commanded from the
Side Stick Controller (SSC) by pressing TMS Aft when both of the following criteria are met:
     •    The TGP MFD format is the Sensor-Of-Interest (SOI).
     •    The TGP is in SLAVE mode (i.e., not in POINT or AREA track).
Snowplow Sighting Mode
Snowplow mode allows the pilot to rapidly reposition the
System-Point-of-Interest (SPI) ahead of the aircraft
when using a “Pre-planned” weapon delivery sub-mode
or when in Navigation master mode.
In situations when it is desirable to use a “Pre-planned”
weapon delivery sub-mode against a target that is not
designated by a steerpoint, Snowplow allows the pilot to
hastily slew the selected steerpoint to a fixed location
directly in front of the aircraft and then ground stabilize
the steerpoint at its current location.
Snowplow mode may be enabled by pressing the
Snowplow (SP) button, which is displayed at OSB 8 on
the FCR or TGP MFD formats in NAV or A-G master
modes when the FCR is set to GM, GMT, or SEA radar
modes, and VIP and VRP sighting modes are not enabled
for the selected steerpoint.
When Snowplow is enabled, the SPI is assigned to the
Snowplow cursor, which corresponds with a fixed
location directly in front of the aircraft.

                                           Snowplow Sighting Method

The Snowplow cursor is placed in three dimensions based on the following.
•    Aircraft Heading. The Snowplow cursor will always remain stabilized with the aircraft centerline and cannot
     be changed. The Snowplow cursor (and the SPI) will turn with the aircraft nose and cannot be moved in the
     lateral axis.
•    Range. The Snowplow cursor will be located along the aircraft centerline at 50% of the FCR’s selected
     range setting, placing the SPI within the center of the MFD FCR format. The pilot may indirectly move the
     Snowplow cursor along the longitudinal axis by selecting a different FCR range setting, even if the FCR is in
     STBY mode or if the RF switch is in QUIET or SILENT positions.
     If the FCR is powered OFF on the SNSR PWR control panel, the Snowplow cursor will be placed at a range
     of 5 NM in front of the aircraft, which cannot be changed.
•    Elevation. The Snowplow cursor is set to the same elevation as the selected steerpoint, independently of
     the actual terrain elevation below it. The pilot may indirectly move the Snowplow cursor in the vertical axis
     by modifying the elevation of the selected steerpoint on the STPT DED page.
     When the aircraft is weight-on-wheels, the Snowplow cursor is set to the same elevation as the aircraft.
When Snowplow is enabled in pre-designate, it may be exited with or without designating (post-designate), or
will be disabled automatically if any of the following criteria are met:
•    The selected steerpoint is changed.
•    VIP or VRP sighting modes are entered.
•    FIX or A-CAL pages are displayed on the DED.
•    The FCR is set to AGR mode, which occurs automatically if a “Visual” weapon delivery sub-mode is entered,
     such as CCIP, STRF, DTOS, STRF, EO-VIS, or VIS; or if the MARK page is displayed on the DED with “HUD”
     as the selected marking method.
•    The FCR is set to CRM or ACM mode, which occurs automatically when entering MSL or DGFT master modes.
Exiting Snowplow via Post-Designate
When Snowplow is enabled, the SPI may be ground stabilized by pressing TMS Forward               Target Management
while the HUD, FCR, or TGP is set as SOI. When this occurs, the selected steerpoint will           Switch (4-way)

be stabilized at that location, incurring a slew to the Navigation cursor, and the
steerpoint elevation will be adjusted to the calculated terrain elevation.
Ground stabilizing the SPI in this manner will automatically exit Snowplow sighting
mode.
Exiting Snowplow from Pre-Designate
When Snowplow is enabled, the SPI may be returned to the previous steerpoint location
without designation by pressing TMS Aft while the HUD, FCR, or TGP is set as SOI; or
by pressing SP (OSB 8) on the FCR or TGP formats. When this occurs, Snowplow mode
will be exited without incurring a slew to the Navigation cursor.
Pressing CZ on the FCR, TGP, or HSD MFD formats while Snowplow mode is enabled
will exit Snowplow sighting mode but will not zeroize any slews that had been
accumulated by the Navigation cursor prior to enabling Snowplow.


“Visual” Weapon Delivery Sub-modes
Attacks against targets of opportunity, independently of steerpoints, may be performed after the pilot has visually
acquired and identified the physical target within the HUD or HMCS, or via electronic sensors such as the targeting
pod (TGP). In these weapon delivery sub-modes, the target location is either manually designated by the pilot
using the Target Designator (TD) Box, or the computed weapon ballistics are calculated from the aircraft’s current
position and the aircraft is maneuvered in such a way to place the weapon ballistic solution over the target itself.
(See the Air-to-Ground Employment chapter for more information regarding each weapon delivery sub-mode.)
“Visual” weapon delivery sub-modes, such as CCIP, DTOS, or STRF, rely on the pilot to visually identify the target
through the canopy before maneuvering the aircraft to engage the target. Since target acquisition is not reliant
on pre-planned steerpoints or the position accuracy of the system navigation solution within the INU, these sub-
modes do not utilize sighting points. As such, sighting point options are not displayed at OSB 10 on the FCR and
TGP MFD formats when a “Visual” weapon delivery sub-mode is in use.
