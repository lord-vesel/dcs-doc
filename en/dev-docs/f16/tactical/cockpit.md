# COCKPIT AND AVIONICS INTERFACE

The F-16C’s cockpit layout and fire control avionics are designed to maximize single-pilot tactical efficiency and
minimize pilot workload in combat. Essential information is presented on the Heads-Up Display (HUD), two
Multifunction Displays (MFD), and the Data Entry Display (DED). These four displays, along with the placement
of the Integrated Control Panel (ICP) and Threat Warning Azimuth Indicator, allow the pilot to remain focused
outside the aircraft as much as possible and, when necessary to look down inside the cockpit, minimize the time
required to be “heads down”.
Most targeting and weapons                                          Primary flight instruments, displays,
controls are placed on the Side                                       and mission equipment controls

The fire control and sensors are
managed through the use of pilot-
selectable master modes. Within
each master mode, each of the F-
16’s sensors, which includes the fire                                       Start-up, shutdown,
control radar (FCR), targeting pod                                           and flight control
                                                                            checks/malfunctions
(TGP), and HARM Targeting System
(HTS), are focused onto a single
geographic     location    in    the                                     Cockpit Workflow
battlespace known as the System-
Point-of-Interest (SPI).
As all aircraft sensors are directed toward the SPI, only one sensor is capable of driving the 3-dimensional location
of the SPI at any given time. When a sensor enters a “tracking” state, such as when the FCR has locked onto
another aircraft or the targeting pod has begun tracking a ground target, the SPI will coincide with the tracking
solution of that sensor. As a result, any remaining sensors will become slaved to the SPI location. However, if a
different sensor is subsequently commanded into a “tracking” state, the remaining sensors will break track from
their target and become slaved to the SPI.
The pilot may interact with only one aircraft sensor at a time, known as the Sensor-Of-Interest (SOI). Many
functions of the Hands-On Controls will be contextually dependent on the current SOI selection, the state of that
sensor, the current weapon delivery sub-mode, and the selected SMS weapon profile. In addition, some MFD
formats (such as the HSD) may be designated as SOI to facilitate interaction through the Hands-On Controls.
