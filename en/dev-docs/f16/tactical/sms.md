# STORES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (SMS)

The SMS MFD format is used for reviewing and configuring loaded munitions and external stores. SMS weapon
profiles and settings are retained for each master mode. When the pilot switches to a different master mode, the
SMS base page will be set to the SMS mode corresponding with the retained settings and/or weapon delivery
sub-mode for the selected master mode.
See the Air-to-Air Employment and Air-to-Ground Employment chapters for more information regarding specific
SMS functions during the employment of weapons.


SMS Inventory (INV) Page
An Inventory page is available that shows external stores loaded on each station. When the aircraft master mode
is set to Navigation, Selective Jettison, or Emergency Jettison modes, the SMS Inventory page is displayed as the
base page. When the aircraft master mode is set to Air-to-Air Missile, Air-to-Ground, Missile Override, or Dogfight
modes, the INV page may be accessed from each respective base page by pressing the INV button (OSB 4).

                                  SMS Inventory Page – Navigation mode


1.     SMS Operating Mode. Displays the operating mode of the of the Stores Management System.
2.     Gun Ammunition Quantity. Displays the remaining ammunition quantity onboard for the M61 20mm
       rotary cannon, in 10 round increments (e.g. “51” indicates 510 rounds remaining).
3.     Gun Ammunition Type. Displays the type of ammunition loaded into the internal ammunition drum. “M56”
       will be displayed for any M50-series ammunition. “PGU-28” will be displayed for any PGU-series ammunition.
4.     External Stores Wingform. Displays external stores installed on underwing and center fuselage pylons,
       including with any associated missile launchers or bomb racks.
5.     Selective Jettison Page. Selects Selective Jettison mode, overriding the current aircraft master mode.
In addition to the gun ammunition type displayed in the top left corner of the inventory page, the SMS will use a
series of weapon and equipment codes to indicate specifically what external stores are loaded onto the underwing
and centerline fuselage stations on the aircraft. A list of these codes is provided on the following page.
Stations 1, 2, 8, and 9 may only be equipped with LAU-129 air-to-air missile rails. These stations are displayed in
a two-line format, with the LAU-129 Missile Rail Launcher on the first line and the corresponding air-to-air weapon
on the second line.




                                        SMS Inventory Page Layout

Stations 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 may be equipped with a variety of external stores, including air-to-air or air-to-ground
munitions, fuel tanks, and ECM or travel pods. These stations are displayed in a three-line format. Depending on
the combination of external munitions or equipment that is installed on these stations, the station data may be
composed of one, two or three lines of data.
In the example above, stations 3, 5, and 7 are installed with a MAU-12 Ejector Rack. However, the MAU-12
installed on station 3 is carrying a TER-9/A Triple Ejector Rack loaded with a pair of GBU-12 laser-guided bombs
and station 7 is carrying a BRU-57/A Smart Multiple Carriage Rack loaded with a pair of GBU-38 inertially-aided
bombs, whilst the MAU-12 on station 5 is simply carrying an ECM pod.

SMS Selective Jettison (S-J) Page
The Selective Jettison page facilitates jettison of individual weapons and/or weapon racks from the external
stations. This allows the pilot to have greater control over what is physically jettisoned from the aircraft. Only
external stores that are capable of being jettisoned will be displayed on the SMS Selective Jettison page. These
include external fuel tanks, air-to-ground weapons, and air-to-ground weapon racks. Air-to-air missiles, air-to-air
missile rails, and ECM/Travel pods cannot be jettisoned and will not be displayed.
When OSB 11 is pressed on the SMS page, Selective Jettison master mode is entered, the SMS Selective Jettison
page is displayed on the SMS MFD format, and “JETT” will be displayed in the HUD Master Mode Status. Pressing
OSB 11 again while the SMS Selective Jettison page is already displayed will exit the Selective Jettison master
mode and return to the previous master mode. Alternatively, if any other master mode is selected, Selective
Jettison mode will be exited.
External stores are selected by pressing the corresponding OSB for that external wing or fuselage station. Any
items that are highlighted in white are selected for jettison. If more than one item exists on a given station, the
first press of the corresponding OSB will enable the lowest external store (shown below on Station 3), and the
second press of the OSB will highlight the next highest external store (shown below on Station 7). An additional
press will disable jettison for all items on that station and the stores will be de-highlighted.
If the Weapon Release button on the Side Stick Controller is pressed while the SMS Selective Jettison page is
displayed, any highlighted external stores will be jettisoned in an unarmed state, regardless of whether the
MASTER ARM switch is set to MASTER ARM, OFF, or SIMULATE.
