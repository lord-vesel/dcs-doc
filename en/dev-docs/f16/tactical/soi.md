# SENSOR-OF-INTEREST (SOI)

The Sensor-Of-Interest is the sensor or display to which the hands-on controls are currently assigned. The
controls on the Side Stick Controller (SSC) and throttle grip, such as the Target Management Switch (TMS),
Expand/FOV button, or RDR CURSOR/ENABLE switch, will only affect the sensor that is currently assigned as SOI.
The SOI can be identified by a white box around the MFD screen or an asterisk in the top left of the HUD.
Additionally, when an MFD is displaying a format that may be assigned as SOI, but is not SOI at the current time,
a “NOT SOI” advisory message will be displayed in the upper portion of the MFD.

The SOI is assigned to the HUD or either MFD by the Display Management Switch (DMS) on the SSC. The MFD
formats that can be assigned as SOI are FCR, TGP, WPN, HSD, and HAD. When re-assigning SOI from the HUD,
if either MFD format can be assigned as SOI, the priority MFD format for the current mode will be set as SOI.
