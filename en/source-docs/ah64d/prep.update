AIRCRAFT HISTORY
The AH-64D is the evolution of the U.S. Army’s need for an airborne platform that is lethal against large numbers
of armored vehicles, readily and continuously available at day or night to support ground force commanders, and
survivable enough to operate in a modern combat environment. Following the experiences of helicopter units in
the Vietnam War, which mainly consisted of small teams of helicopters engaged in light combat, the emerging
environments that military helicopters were expected to be operating within contained large-scale armor units
supported by sophisticated air defense systems. Army Aviation needed to procure an advanced attack helicopter
that could be effectively lethal and survivable in heavy combat, regardless of the time of day.


Advanced Aerial Fire Support System
In 1948, the Key West Agreement codified the separation of air assets between the U.S. Army and the newly
founded U.S. Air Force. Doctrinally, the Air Force would be tasked to provide fixed-wing aircraft for the close air
support (CAS) role with a new generation of fighter aircraft, while Army Aviation was limited to small and light
fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft since, at the time, such aircraft were expected to be limited to utility and logistics.
In 1960, the Secretary of Defense, Robert S. McNamara, revisited this agreement by creating the Army Tactical
Mobility Requirements Board. The board and its chairman, Lieutenant General Hamilton H. Howze, recommended
that Army Aviation be greatly expanded to include a well-developed attack role, among many others. McNamara
followed the board’s recommendation, which generated contention among Air Force leadership, insistent that
fixed-wing fighters were the only effective platforms for performing CAS.
 Army leadership was determined to procure their own close
 air support aircraft and initiated the Advanced Aerial Fire
 Support System (AAFSS) program in 1963 to design a
 purpose-built attack helicopter, rather than an armed variant
 of an existing utility helicopter. The request for proposals was
 announced in 1964; and in 1968 Lockheed was awarded the
 contract with its proposal for the AH-56 Cheyenne.
 Consequently, the Air Force initiated the A-X program in 1966
 (even before the AH-56 contract had been awarded to
 Lockheed) to develop a purpose-built CAS aircraft to fulfill
 the same missions to which the AH-56 was intended to
 Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne (US Army) perform, which would eventually result in the A-10. However,
 by the end of the 1960’s the U.S. military’s strategic concern
shifted to the large numbers of tanks that Warsaw Pact countries could employ in a European ground war. Thus,
priorities for aircraft development shifted from close air support to the anti-armor role, and in 1972 the Army
canceled development of the AH-56 in favor of a program to develop a more capable anti-tank platform.


Joint Attack Helicopter Instrumented Evaluation
In 1972, the NATO Armaments Group conducted a series of tests in Ansbach, Germany, to determine the viability
of employing attack helicopters against large numbers of armored vehicles supported by mobile, short-range air
defenses. The final report concluded that helicopters could be extremely effective in destroying an attacking
armored ground force by utilizing hovering fire from standoff ranges. When employing anti-armor munitions, the
assessed kill ratios averaged 15 tracked vehicles destroyed for every helicopter lost.
By 1975, AH-1G attack helicopters (which were limited to carrying rockets, grenade launchers, and miniguns)
were being replaced by AH-1Q variants that could employ BGM-71 TOW anti-armor missiles; and shortly
thereafter, night-capable AH-1S helicopters were fielded. However, the TOW-equipped AH-1 was considered an
interim solution for an anti-armor helicopter that could fight and survive amongst increasingly sophisticated air
defenses consisting of radar-controlled antiaircraft guns and shoulder-fired, infrared-guided missiles.
Advanced Attack Helicopter Program
The U.S. Army’s Advanced Attack Helicopter (AAH) program to develop a night-capable, anti-tank helicopter got
underway in January 1972. Despite the fact that the AAH requirements were for an aircraft that would be smaller
(though more agile), slower, and less sophisticated than what was originally envisioned in the Advanced Aerial
Fire Support System, the AAH program still faced several technological hurdles. These challenges were
compounded by the need to update U.S. Army doctrine in employing such an aircraft in combat and modernizing
Army Aviation’s equipment and training for performing low-level flight at night.
The AAH program’s request for proposals (RFP) was announced in November 1972, approximately six months
after the Ansbach tests concluded. The RFP specified that the helicopter would need to operate at night at
extremely low altitudes, should utilize the same General Electric T700 engine as the Utility Tactical Transport
Aircraft System (which would eventually evolve into the UH-60), and should be armed with a 30mm cannon and
16 anti-tank BGM-71 TOW missiles. The RFP was later amended to include a requirement to carry 16 AGM-114
missiles in place of the TOW, which would more than double the standoff engagement range of the airframe.
Bell, Boeing-Vertol/Grumman, Hughes, Lockheed, and Sikorsky all submitted proposals for the AAH program. In
July of 1973, the Department of Defense selected the Bell Model 409 and the Hughes Model 77 as the prototypes
that would be built to compete for the contract in Phase 1 of the AAH program.




 Bell Model 409 (US Army) Hughes Model 77 (US Army)

The Hughes Model 77, designated YAH-64, first flew on September 30, 1975. The Bell Model 409, designated the
YAH-63, performed its first flight only a day later. After a series of flight tests and trials, the Army decided to
move ahead with the Hughes YAH-64, citing its increased survivability over the YAH-63.


AH-64A
Per Phase 2 of the AAH program, the YAH-64 entered pre-
production. The airframe, redesignated as the AH-64A, was
integrated with the weapon and targeting systems it would
employ in combat.
The AH-64A was equipped with two revolutionary targeting
systems: the Integrated Helmet And Designation Sighting
System (IHADSS) and the Target Acquisition Designation
Sight (TADS). IHADSS and TADS enabled aircrews to
navigate mere feet over the terrain and amongst obstacles
under total darkness, acquire and engage targets at long-
range, and rapidly engage targets with the 30mm cannon
using helmet-mounted sights. Combined with the Pilot Night Pre-production version of the AH-64A (US Army)
Vision System (PNVS), these sighting systems made the AH-
64A a lethal day and night attack aircraft.
 Three AH-64As were delivered to the Army in 1981 for
 Operational Test II at Fort Hunter-Liggett, California. In
 1982, the engines were upgraded to the more powerful
 T700-GE-701, with 1,690 shaft horsepower (SHP), and the
 Army approved the AH-64A for full-scale production. In 1983,
 the first production AH-64A rolled off the assembly line at
 Hughes’s production facility in Mesa, Arizona. In January
 1984, the Army took delivery of its first AH-64A; and in March
 Final production version of the AH-64A (US Army) 1986, began training its first operational unit, 7th Battalion,
 17th Cavalry Brigade, at Fort Hood, Texas.
The AH-64A proved to be exceptionally nimble at low speeds, capable
of weaving through tree lines and amongst the terrain contours, even
when armed with a full combat load. Each AH-64A could be equipped
with four quad-rail missile launchers for carrying a full load of 16
AGM-114 missiles in the anti-armor role. Alternatively, two of the
missile launchers could be replaced by a pair of 19-tube rocket
launchers for reconnaissance, security, or fire support missions. In
addition, 1,200 rounds of 30mm ammunition could be carried for the
single-barrel automatic cannon, which was effective against light
armor, unarmored vehicles, and personnel.
The AH-64A was also designed with a high degree of survivability
from lessons learned in Vietnam, including strategically placed armor,
systems redundancy, fire retarding systems, self-sealing and inerting
fuel cells, infrared suppression, and crashworthiness in the event of
a high-rate vertical impact with the ground.
Over 1,000 AH-64As were produced, most of which have since been AH-64A firing unguided rockets (US Army)
upgraded to the D model. The AH-64A was operated by the U.S.
Army until July 2012, when the last A model was taken out of service.


AirLand Battle
Throughout the 1980’s, Army Aviation continued to evolve its night-fighting capabilities, with night-time flight
training constituting approximately a third of all flight training that was conducted. Simultaneously, the U.S. Army
as a whole was devising an entirely new doctrine of warfighting, termed “AirLand Battle”.
 AirLand Battle doctrine involved a greater integration of combined-
 arms maneuvers, synchronizing the efforts of armor, artillery, and
 aviation units at the division level or higher. The AH-64A would play
 a key role in this combined-arms fight, being employed in entire
 platoons, companies, or battalions, in a similar manner as tank units.
 The AH-64A would not only augment armor units by providing fire
 support along the front line but would be capable of performing deep
 attacks beyond the FLOT (Forward Line of Own Troops),
 independently of ground forces, engaging enemy targets from
 standoff ranges and relying on nap-of-the-earth (NOE) flying to
 minimize exposure to enemy air defense systems.
 Artillery and MLRS units would also play a key role in the Army’s
 attacks in depth by providing fire support and suppression of enemy
 air defenses (SEAD). Alternatively, when performing deep attacks
 AH-64A performing weapon tests (US Army) beyond the range of friendly artillery, Army AH-64’s could be
 supported by Air Force or Navy/Marine Corps fixed-wing aircraft
 providing SEAD.
Gulf War (Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm)
The AH-64A first saw combat in 1989 as part of Operation Just Cause, the U.S. invasion of Panama. But it wouldn’t
be until Operation Desert Shield in 1990 that the AH-64A would be deployed in significant numbers for a large-
scale conflict.
In January 1991, eight AH-64A’s from the U.S. Army’s 101st Airborne
Division, along with four MH-53J Pave Low helicopters from the U.S.
Air Force’s 20th Special Operations Squadron, struck the first targets
in Iraq during the opening hours of Operation Desert Storm. Their
mission was to destroy two early warning radar sites along the border
between Saudi Arabia and Iraq to allow coalition aircraft to funnel
through the hole in radar coverage to begin the air campaign against
the Iraqi military. Both radar sites needed to be destroyed quickly,
simultaneously, and completely, to prevent the Iraqi air defense
network from detecting the incoming coalition aircraft or receiving
advance warning of the impending air attack.
Throughout the fall of 1990 and into January 1991, the Army and Air
Force crews continuously rehearsed the various aspects of the
mission, from formation flying to navigating long distance routes at
night while flying no more than 100 feet over the terrain. However,
it wasn’t until the evening of January 16th, hours before the mission
itself, that the aircrews were finally briefed on the nature of their
mission. Each team, “Red Team” and “White Team”, consisted of four
AH-64A’s and two MH-53J’s, with the western radar site assigned to
Red Team and the eastern radar site assigned to White Team. AH-64As during Desert Shield (US DoD)

At midnight the joint helicopter force began spooling up their engines. Each team departed separately using
precise timing so they would arrive at their designated targets simultaneously. Flying radio silent and guided
across the featureless desert by the GPS navigation units on board the MH-53’s, the two teams of Army and Air
Force helicopters navigated over 130 miles through the darkness, attracting only momentary small arms fire and
an errant missile as they crossed the border into southern Iraq.
As the Pave Lows arrived over the pre-briefed initial points, their crews dropped bundles of chemlights onto the
surface to mark the location. One by one, each AH-64 hovered over the chemlights and updated their inertial
navigation systems before regrouping and proceeding to their respective targets, while the MH-53’s departed to
their designated holding area. Advancing slowly at low altitude, the AH-64’s successfully reached their attack
positions without detection, and each AH-64 aircrew acquired their assigned targets through their Forward-
Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensors. With a single radio call, the attack commenced at precisely 2:38 AM on January
17th with an onslaught of Hellfire missiles, followed by rockets and 30mm cannon fire. Within minutes, the radar
sites were completely annihilated, and scores of coalition aircraft streamed through the gap in radar coverage to
begin the air campaign phase of Operation Desert Storm.
 Leading up to the ground phase of Desert Storm in the following
 month, AH-64 units began conducting deep attacks at night against
 Iraqi armor units. These deep attacks were supported by EF-111 and
 EC-130 electronic warfare aircraft providing suppression of enemy air
 defenses (SEAD) in the form of jamming and deception, while several
 artillery battalions remained on call to provide additional SEAD if
 required. When the ground phase finally commenced on February
 24th, battalions of AH-64A attack helicopters were launched en masse
 against multiple objectives forward of friendly ground forces. On
 several occasions, an entire brigade of Iraqi armor was decimated by
 a single battalion of AH-64A helicopters in a single battle, solidifying
 AH-64A equipped for an anti-armor the Army’s use of attack helicopters as an effective anti-armor force
 mission during Desert Storm (US DoD) that was capable of attacking enemy forces in depth.
AH-64A+, AH-64B, and other upgrade proposals
As early as 1984, upgrades and additional AH-64 variants were
being proposed by McDonnell Douglas (which had since acquired
Hughes shortly after the AH-64A entered service) and offered to
the U.S. Army and other potential buyers. Notably, the U.S. Marine
Corps expressed interest in a “Sea Apache” variant, but the type
was never procured due to high costs.
Many alternative weapons were also suggested for addition to the
AH-64A’s arsenal, including other types of anti-tank missiles, air-
to-air missiles, and even anti-ship missiles. In particular, efforts to
arm the AH-64A with air-to-air missiles proceeded as far as weapon
test-firings of the AIM-9 Sidewinder and the Air-To-Air Stinger
(ATAS) system between 1987 and 1989. Even the anti-radar AGM-
122 Sidearm (derived from the AIM-9 missile) was successfully
tested in 1988. However, none of these efforts gained traction and AH-64A mock-up with Sidewinder and ATAS
the U.S. Army never upgraded its AH-64 fleet for air-to-air missile missile systems (McDonnell Douglas)
capability.


Multi-Stage Improvement Program (MSIP)
In 1988, McDonnell Douglas began to develop various upgrade proposals for the AH-64A, referred to as
“Advanced Apache”, “Apache Plus”, or the “AH-64B”. These proposals would have included numerous upgrades,
such as a revised and updated cockpit, digital electronics, a new fire control and gun system, improved sensors
and communications, and Stinger air-to-air missiles. However, the MSIP proposals never proceeded beyond their
concept stages.
Following the Gulf War, a more modest “AH-64A+” upgrade program was proposed that included improved
communications in the form of SINCGARS and HF radios, GPS-aided navigation, a ground-proximity warning
system, sand filtration kits, an improved flight computer, and accuracy improvements to the PNVS/TADS and the
30mm gun. Although some of these changes such as the SINCGARS radios and GPS receivers were eventually
incorporated into the AH-64A fleet, the original A+ upgrade program was largely abandoned in favor of the much
more ambitious AH-64D upgrade program.


Airborne Adverse Weather Weapon System (AAWWS)
 In the late 1980’s, research and development was underway for the
 AAWWS, a radar targeting system that could be mounted on top of
 the AH-64’s rotor mast. The radar system would enable the AH-64 to
 acquire ground or air targets while remaining masked behind terrain,
 trees, or other obstructions, even in low visibility. The targeting data
 could then be passed to other friendly assets in the combined-arms
 battlespace, such as other helicopters, artillery, command centers,
 intelligence networks, or fixed-wing fighters and strike aircraft.
 By 1992, the AAWWS had evolved into the AN/APG-78 fire control
 radar and was to be fitted to the AH-64D that was under
 development. The APG-78 would enable the AH-64D to navigate at
 low altitudes in low-visibility conditions, acquire and classify
 battlefield targets faster, remain hidden behind terrain longer to
 avoid air defenses, and transfer targeting and reconnaissance data
 to other AH-64D’s in real-time. The AAWWS had the potential to
 Maintenance personnel inspect an AH-64D’s
 mast-mounted assembly (US Army)
 transform a team of AH-64’s into a devastating anti-armor force.
Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI)
In February of 1993, the U.S. Army Aviation Center at Fort Rucker, Alabama, initiated the Aviation Restructure
Initiative with the objective to modernize, reorganize, and standardize aviation units across the Army. At the
time, the Army Aviation fleet was composed of many rotary- and fixed-wing airframe types. As part of the
modernization, the number of helicopter types was reduced from 10 to 5 and the number of fixed-wing types
was reduced from 8 to 4. Among the changes that were to be made as part of the ARI, one particular change
impacted the structure of the attack helicopter battalions and the AH-64’s role within it.
Leading up to the 1990’s, the structure of the Attack
Helicopter Battalion (ATKHB) consisted of 18 AH-64A, 13
OH-58C, and 3 UH-60 helicopters. Although the OH-
58C’s were also used for liaison and courier duties, the
principal warfighting function of the OH-58C within the
ATKHB was to serve as an “aeroscout” for the AH-64A.
However, the OH-58C was a 1960’s airframe that was
proving to be increasingly limited as an aeroscout for the
AH-64. The OH-58C lacked the speed and survivability to
operate effectively alongside the AH-64 in a modern
conflict, nor did it have adequate sensors to detect and
classify targets, relying solely on the pilots’ eyesight.
Following the reorganization of ARI, the structure of the
ATKHB transitioned to a single-airframe unit, consisting
of 24 AH-64’s across three flight companies. Each flight
company would be assigned three AH-64’s to fulfill the
scout role, with five AH-64’s to perform attack missions.
These changes in unit structure laid the foundation for
 OH-58C and AH-64A “hunter-killer team” (US Army)
integration of the AH-64D within the Army’s attack
helicopter battalions, with each flight company receiving
three FCR kits for each AH-64D within the scout platoon.
 By employing the AH-64A in the aeroscout role, the scout platoons
 would gain a significant increase in their ability to detect and classify
 targets on the battlefield, especially at night. In daytime, the AH-64A
 had four times the target detection range and eight times the target
 classification range compared to the OH-58C. At night, the OH-58C’s
 ability to detect targets was practically non-existent while the AH-
 64A’s FLIR could detect and classify targets at approximately two-
 thirds the range of its own DTV during the day. The weapon systems,
 defensive equipment, and night operations capability of the AH-64A
 also increased the aircraft’s survivability in combat compared to the
 OH-58C.
 Following the introduction of the upgraded AH-64D, the addition of
 the APG-78 FCR in the scout platoons greatly enhanced and
 accelerated the process of target detection and classification. The
 APR-48 RFI, which shared the mast-mounted assembly with the FCR,
 allowed the AH-64D scout platoons to receive early warning of enemy
 air defense systems and subsequently target them for destruction; a
 capability that neither the AH-64A nor the OH-58C possessed.
 However, it is worth noting that the improved communications and
 direct transmission of real-time targeting data to other AH-64D’s is
 what truly allowed the FCR-equipped AH-64D’s to assume the
 AH-64D equipped with the mast-mounted aeroscout role from the OH-58C.
 AN/APG-78 Fire Control Radar (US Army)
AH-64D
 Following Operation Desert Storm in 1991, the AH-64A+
 upgrade proposed by McDonnell Douglas was approved
 and funded by the U.S. Congress but was canceled merely
 a year later in favor of the AH-64D proposal. The AH-64D
 upgrade program was a significantly more robust update
 to the AH-64 fleet, incorporating many aspects of the MSIP
 and AAWWS programs of the late 1980’s.
 The most obvious external differences between the AH-
 64A and the AH-64D are the presence of the AN/APG-78
 Fire Control Radar (FCR) mounted above the main rotor of
 some AH-64D’s and the expanded avionics bays on either
 side of the forward fuselage to accommodate the
 additional computer processing capability. The AH-64A air
 data system mounted above the rotor head was replaced
 by a pair of Airspeed And Direction Sensor (AADS) probes
 mounted to each engine nacelle. The left and right
 navigation and anti-collision light assemblies were also
 relocated to the engine nacelles to accommodate growth
 AH-64D (US Army) options for wingtip mounted air-to-air missiles, though
 such weapons were never integrated into U.S. AH-64D’s.
The cockpit layout within each crewstation received significant modifications through a program called Manpower
and Personnel Integration (MANPRINT), which focused on the human factors in optimizing the cockpit workflows.
By replacing the analog instruments with a pair of 6 x 6 inch color multi-purpose displays (MPD) and an upfront
display (UFD), the crew is presented with more data in an efficient “management by exception” approach,
allowing them to gain and maintain greater situational awareness and make decisions more quickly and
effectively. Further, replacing most of the switches and knobs in the cockpit with contextual options on the MPDs,
a keyboard unit (KU) for data entry, and expanding the hands-on controls, allowed the crewmembers to interact
with the aircraft systems, sensors, and fire control computer more efficiently and accomplish cockpit tasks rapidly.
The avionics improvements
also included GPS-integrated
navigation, a fully integrated
communications suite with
SINCGARS radios, a modem
for transmitting data, and
avionics supporting a MIL-STD
1553B data bus. AH-64D’s
would also eventually receive
the ARC-220 High Frequency
(HF) radio for non-line-of-sight
and over-the-horizon voice
and data communications.
Along with the improvements
to the avionics and the
addition of the mast-mounted
FCR, the AH-64D could employ
the AGM-114L, a “fire-and- Aft cockpit of the AH-64A with analog gauges and switches (Left) and the aft cockpit of
forget” variant of the missile the AH-64D featuring the MANPRINT cockpit design and layout (Right) (US Army)
that uses autonomous radar
guidance instead of the semi-active laser-homing guidance of previous versions. However, the AH-64D still
retained the capability to employ existing laser-guided variants alongside the radar-guided AGM-114L.
Unfortunately, the upgrades and additional equipment came with an increase in gross weight and a reduced
power-to-weight ratio. To improve performance in “hot and high” conditions, the engines were replaced with the
more powerful T700-GE-701C engines rated at 1,940 shaft horsepower (SHP). It is worth noting that the original
plans were for the upgraded airframes to be designated as AH-64C and AH-64D, with the AH-64C lacking the
FCR and the upgraded 701C engines. However, this additional designation proved to be redundant since the FCR
system components themselves were interchangeable between the AH-64C and AH-64D. The designation was
subsequently dropped, with all airframes being designated AH-64D. Eventually, all AH-64D’s (and even some AH-
64A’s) received the upgraded 701C engines.
The addition of the mast-mounted APG-78 Fire Control Radar and the upgraded communications equipment
enhances the organic aeroscout capability for AH-64D-equipped units, allowing a single FCR-equipped AH-64D to
instantaneously distribute targeting data to seven other AH-64D’s in the vicinity. In addition, the AH-64D’s
networking capabilities allows any AH-64D within the attack helicopter battalion to share reconnaissance
information or mission updates in near real-time with two entire flight companies of aircraft at once, if necessary.
 When performing attacks in depth, the AH-64D can relay
 reconnaissance information and situation updates across
 long distances with the addition of the near-vertical incidence
 skywave (NVIS) antenna for non-LOS communications using
 the HF radio. This can be especially valuable when operating
 at low altitudes or when terrain obstructs normal radio line-
 of-sight.
 The mast-mounted AN/APR-48 Radar Frequency
 Interferometer (RFI) provides the AH-64D with an improved
 early-warning of air defenses. When coupled with the FCR
 and fire-and-forget AGM-114L missiles, the RFI also provides
 the AH-64D with an inherent self-defense capability against
 short-range air defense systems, which is crucial during deep
 attacks beyond the range of friendly artillery that would
 otherwise provide suppression of enemy air defenses.
 The first D model prototype was flown in April of 1992, and
 by 1995 testing had concluded and full-scale production was
 AH-64D (US Army) underway. The first Block 1 AH-64D was delivered to the U.S.
 Army on March 31, 1997.
The Army began receiving Block 2 airframes in 2003, which featured moving map underlays for the Tactical
Situation Display (TSD), an Enhanced Upfront Display (EUFD), a new datalink modem, a digital video recording
system, and dedicated search and rescue equipment in the form of an emergency locator transmitter (ELT) and
an underwater acoustic beacon.


Modernized TADS/PNVS (M-TADS)
Despite the various upgrades within the AH-64D, the original TADS and PNVS sensors from the AH-64A had
remained unchanged. In 2005, the Army began re-fitting the AH-64D fleet with the “Modernized TADS/PNVS”
system, or simply “M-TADS”. The M-TADS upgrade featured next generation FLIR cameras for the nose-mounted
TADS and PNVS sensors, and an expanded PNVS turret housing with an additional sensor aperture for future
growth. The new FLIR sensors produced video with higher resolution and fidelity, allowing crews to detect and
classify targets at greater ranges and see more detail of their surroundings during operations at night.
In addition, the M-TADS included upgraded digital tracking logic with a multi-target tracking capability and an
automated boresighting process. The existing Optical Relay Tube (ORT) assembly in the Copilot/Gunner
crewstation was replaced with the TADS Electronic Display And Control (TEDAC) assembly, which featured a
larger video screen with better resolution.
Survivability Improvements
In the same year that the M-TADS was making its way to
the U.S. Army fleet, a new missile warning and defense
system was also being fielded. The AN/AAR-57 Common
Missile Warning System (CMWS) was intended to improve
the AH-64D’s defense against infrared (IR)-guided missile
threats. The modifications included a missile warning
system to notify the crew of potential missile threats within
the vicinity and two flare dispensers mounted to the tail
boom. The flare dispensers allowed the crew to eject flares
to decoy heat-seeking missiles away from the aircraft. The
CMWS electronics could also be enabled to automatically
dispense flares without crew interaction, if desired.
In 2006, the U.S. Army began modifying AH-64D engine
nacelles with a new exhaust cowling and nozzle. These
 AH-64D departing FOB Tarin Kowt, Afghanistan
revised nozzles redirected the engine exhaust upward into (US Army photo by SSG Tracy Hohman)
the rotor system to dissipate the engine exhaust and
reduce the effectiveness of IR-guided missiles.


Proliferation and Export
Since August 1997, Boeing (which had acquired McDonnell-Douglas) has produced AH-64D’s domestically for the
United States and for foreign partners. Partnered with Boeing, AgustaWestland produced AH-64D’s (designated
AH Mk1) for the United Kingdom’s Army Air Corps, and Fuji Heavy Industries produced AH-64D’s (designated AH-
64DJP) for the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force.
Along with the U.S., U.K., and Japan, the AH-64D is also operated by the militaries of the Netherlands, Greece,
Israel, Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Singapore.




 UK Army Air Corps AH Mk1 (UK MoD) RNLAF AH-64Ds in Afghanistan (RNLAF)


In addition to newly manufactured AH-64D’s, the U.S. Army awarded McDonnell-Douglas a $1.9 billion contract
to upgrade existing A models to D models. Starting in August of 1997, Boeing (which had acquired McDonnel-
Douglas in 1997) has since upgraded all U.S. Army AH-64A’s to D models. In all, 2,400 AH-64’s have been
produced since 1983; over a thousand of them as AH-64D’s.
AIRCRAFT OVERVIEW
The AH-64D is a two-person day/night attack helicopter initially developed by McDonnell Douglas for the U.S.
Army. The helicopter was originally designed by Hughes for the anti-tank role, employing the AGM-114 Hellfire
missile as its primary weapon. Its design incorporates significant survivability and systems redundancy after
lessons learned in the Vietnam war. The AH-64D provides the U.S Army (and other militaries) with one of the
most maneuverable, survivable, and heavily armed rotary-winged aircraft on the modern battlefield.




DCS: AH-64D features a U.S. Army AH-64D Block 2 in service between the years of 2005-2010. The DCS: AH-
64D simulates Lot 9.1 avionics, which was fielded in 2005, along with additional equipment that was fielded to
the U.S Army fleet between 2005 and 2007, such as the Modernized TADS (M-TADS), Common Missile Warning
System (CMWS), and revised engine nozzle assemblies.


Cockpit
 The AH-64D uses a tandem cockpit
 layout, with the Pilot (PLT) in the aft
 cockpit and the Copilot/Gunner (CPG)
 in the forward cockpit. Identical flight
 controls are present in both cockpits,
 and each can employ any of the AH-
 64’s weapon systems, but the Pilot
 lacks several targeting and weapon
 employment controls that are only
 present in the CPG cockpit.
 Both cockpits are protected with
 ballistic armor, and an additional
 ballistic shield separates the two
 cockpits. Each crewmember sits within
an armored seat that is mounted on compressible pistons that stroke downward during high-speed vertical
impacts. Coupled with the stroking action of the landing gear, this system is designed to attenuate the impact
forces translated to the crewmembers’ spines, resulting in higher survival rates during crash sequences.
Both cockpit canopies consist of two heated glass windshields, four acrylic side panels, and a fifth acrylic panel
over the Pilot’s crewstation. The canopy doors open upward and to the side for ingress and egress, and manually
latched for flight. Improper latching is detected and annunciated by the onboard avionics.
For emergency egress, both cockpits include a canopy jettison system. Jettison handles are installed for the Pilot
and CPG, as well as an exterior jettison handle for rescue personnel. The jettison system consists of a detonating
cord that ejects the four acrylic side panels for crew egress.


Fuselage
The AH-64D fuselage is armored in
strategic locations, with 2,500
pounds of ballistic shielding
designed to sustain hits from
projectiles up to 23mm in caliber.
The aft fuselage includes three
integral fire/overheat detectors:
one adjacent the main transmission,
and one on each firewall louver door
(where transmission oil is cooled).
The indication of a fire in these
areas will trigger a visual and audio
warning to the crew.
Critical system relays and wiring are installed in opposing areas, permitting redundancy within the avionics in the
case of computer failure or damage. Each processor group is composed of two individual computers: one primary
and one backup. If the primary processor fails or is damaged from weapons fire, the backup processor
immediately takes over the required computing tasks.


Fire Protection System
Engine fire detection is provided by two optical flame detectors in each engine compartment, and two in the APU
compartment. Two fire bottles, a primary and a reserve, contain halon fire suppressant. If a fire is detected in
either engine compartment or the APU compartment, a voice warning message will announce to the crew the
location of the fire, along with fire warning lights on the instrument panel. These warning lights will illuminate
which buttons the crew must press to discharge the fire suppressant in an attempt to extinguish the fire.
An additional fire detection circuit is installed into the aft deck area behind the main transmission, near the
accessory gearbox and between the two engines. This fire detection circuit will generate a voice warning message
and an AFT DECK FIRE warning on the EUFD, but there is no fire suppression capability in this area.


Engines
The AH-64D is powered by two General Electric T700-GE-701C turboshaft engines, each generating up to 1,940
shaft horsepower. The engine output shafts are coupled with frontal-mounted nose gearboxes and regulated by
a Digital Electronic Control (DEC) and integral Hydro-Mechanical Units (HMU). Each engine is assembled in a
modular layout, consisting of a cold section, hot section, power turbine section, and accessory section.
 The cold section consists of an inlet particle
 Maintenance platform stand Nose gearbox separator for dust and sand protection, a six-
 stage compressor, variable inlet guide vanes
 (IGVs), and variable stator vanes. The DEC is
 mounted to underside of the cold section.
 The hot section consists of the annular
 combustor, nozzle assembly and gas
 generator turbine stages. The gas generator is
 connected to the cold section’s compressor
 Power turbine stage
 “danger” markings Maintenance platform brace through a central shaft, which rotates the
 compressor stage to produce self-sustaining
 engine power.
The power turbine section consists of two free turbine stages and the exhaust frame. The power turbine shaft
rotates within the gas generator compressor shaft and runs the full length of the engine to the front-mounted
nose gearbox. The engine turbine gas temperature (TGT) thermocouples are mounted to this stage, just aft of
the gas generator stages, along with the engine speed and torque sensors that provide cockpit indications of N P
and TQ respectfully.
The accessory section includes the HMU, NG speed sensor, fuel boost pump, oil system, and the Air Turbine
Starter. Each engine’s nose-mounted reduction gearbox powers the main transmission through an over-running
“sprag” clutch that will disengage the engine from the main transmission if the powertrain system is operating at
a higher RPM than the engine’s power turbine.


Digital Electronic Control and Hydro-Mechanical Unit
The DEC and HMU work together to manage each engine, managing fuel flow based on the position of the power
levers and collective handles. The power lever position is mechanically transmitted to the HMU via a Power
Available Spindle (PAS), and the collective position mechanically via a Load Demand Spindle (LDS). During normal
operation, the HMU controls fuel flow to the combustor according to the PAS and LDS. The HMU also schedules
the inlet guide vanes, controls the anti-ice and start bleed valve, and regulates discharge air pressure and NG
(gas generator RPM). The HMU includes an automatic NG overspeed cut-off that will flame out the engine to
prevent an engine overspeed.
The DEC coordinates automatic torque load-sharing between the two engines, monitors NP (power turbine RPM),
and limits turbine gas temperature (TGT). Like the HMU’s automatic NG overspeed cut-off, the DEC has an
automatic NP overspeed cut-off. The DEC is normally powered by the engine’s alternator but can use aircraft
power as a backup. The DEC for each engine can be disabled by momentarily placing the engine’s power lever
into the “lock-out” position.
The DEC has a contingency power feature that automatically activates during single-engine operations. If an
engine fails, the DEC of the opposite engine automatically increases the TGT limiter of the remaining engine to a
higher value, permitting an increase in operating temperature at the expense of engine life.


Starter System
The starter system consists of a pneumatic starter valve, an ignition system with two igniter plugs, and the DEC.
Pneumatic pressure for engine start can be supplied by the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), Aircraft Ground Power
Unit (AGPU), or a running engine (cross-bleed start).
During engine start, the DEC will monitor engine parameters and automatically abort the start if an imminent hot
start is detected.
Auxiliary Power Unit (APU)
The GTCP36-155 APU, manufactured by Allied Signal/Garret, is a self-contained gas turbine engine that drives
the accessory section of the main transmission to generate electrical and hydraulic power without operating the
main engines or rotating the rotor blades. The APU can generate pressurized air, which is primarily used to start
the main engines without requiring external ground power sources.
The APU draws fuel from the aft fuel cell only
and consumes approximately 175 pounds per
hour when operating.
The APU is automatically monitored by an
Electronic Control Unit (ECU), which detects
overspeed and overcurrent anomalies, as well as
abnormal oil pressure. The ECU will
automatically shut down the APU when an APU exhaust duct
anomaly is detected. The ECU also controls the
power takeoff (PTO) clutch engagement to the
accessory section of the main transmission.


Drivetrain
The main rotor drive system consists of the main rotor drive shaft, main rotor transmission, three-stage reduction
gearing, and dual independent integral oil systems. The main transmission receives power from two nose gearbox
inputs, one mounted on each turboshaft engine. The main transmission is used to drive the main rotor.


 Tail Rotor Gearbox
 Engines
 Main Transmission




 Intermediate Gearbox
 APU & APU drive shaft
 Nose Gearboxes




An accessory gearbox is mounted to the aft side of the main transmission. This gearbox provides mechanical
power to the aircraft’s two electrical AC generators and two hydraulic pumps, one for the Primary hydraulic
system and the other for the Utility hydraulic system. This prevents the loss of generator and hydraulic power
during an autorotation when both engines have failed. The APU powers the transmission’s accessory gearbox via
the APU drive shaft, which provides full electrical power to the aircraft avionics and hydraulic power to the flight
controls prior to starting the main engines. The accessory gearbox also includes the rotor brake and the main
rotor RPM (NR) sensor.
The tail rotor drive system consists of the tail rotor drive shaft, intermediate gearbox, and tail rotor gearbox. The
tail rotor drive shaft consists of four sections within the tail boom. The sections are connected with flexible
couplings and mounted with hanger bearings to accommodate aerodynamic and maneuvering loads from the tail
boom. The intermediate gearbox is at the base of the vertical stabilizer, and the tail rotor gearbox is at the base
of the tail rotor static mast. Both gearboxes reduce the transmission RPM and change the angle of the drive.
The main and tail rotor drive shafts are designed to carry torque loads only. Each of these shafts pass through
and rotate within a static mast. The main rotor static mast carries all vertical and bending loads, and the tail rotor
static mast absorbs all tail rotor loads. This allows the aircraft to perform aggressive or aerobatic maneuvers
while minimizing stresses to the drive train system.


Rotors
The AH-64D has a four-blade main rotor for lift and propulsion, and a four-blade tail rotor for anti-torque and
directional control.

The main rotor is fully articulated, with each blade able to
flap, feather, lead, and lag independently. Mechanical
droop stops under each Pitch Change Housing limits blade Delta hinge

droop. 55°

The four-blade tail rotor is semi-rigid of a teetering design.
Each opposing pair of rotor blades are offset at 55° for
ease of maintenance and to increase tail rotor efficiency.
Flapping and feathering of the tail rotor to counter
dissymmetry of lift in forward flight is facilitated by the use
of a delta hinge installed to each pair of tail rotor blades.
Flight Controls
AH-64D flight controls are hydromechanical, consisting of mechanical linkages between the flight controls and
control surfaces, augmented by transmission-driven hydraulic power. The flight controls are conventional and
consist of a cyclic stick, collective lever, and anti-torque pedals.
The cyclic is mechanically connected to the swashplate on the rotor mast that tilts the main rotor for attitude
control using cyclic feathering of the rotor blades. The collective is mechanically connected to the swashplate and
each engine’s Load Demand Spindle (LDS) and directly controls lift by collectively feathering all rotor blades at
once. The anti-torque pedals feather the tail rotor blades for anti-torque and directional control.


 Directional (Yaw) servo-actuator

 Collective servo-actuator
 Lateral (Roll) servo-actuator




 Longitudinal (Pitch) servo-actuator




Hydraulic augmentation is provided by the Stability and Command Augmentation System (SCAS), which consists
of electro-hydraulic actuators commanded by the Flight Management Computer (FMC). The FMC provides rate
damping and enhanced aircraft stability for accurate weapons employment; and command augmentation for
immediate, smooth, and consistent control feel across the full range of helicopter airspeeds. The FMC also
provides attitude and altitude hold capability for limited hands-off flying.
The AH-64D has an articulating horizontal stabilator
 Static discharge wick Asymmetric Gurney flaps
controlled by an electric actuator. The horizontal
stabilator improves pitch control and improves over-
the-nose visibility at low airspeeds. In automatic
mode, the FMC schedules the horizontal stabilator
position according to collective position and airspeed.
In nap-of-the-earth/approach mode (NOE/A), the
horizontal stabilator is driven to the 25° trailing edge
down position when below 80 knots, to further
improve over-the-nose visibility. In manual mode, either crewmember may control the stabilator position with a
switch on the collective.
To ease pilot workload, a force trim system is provided for the cyclic and pedals. The force trim system consists
of lateral, longitudinal, and directional force trim springs and magnetic solenoids that engage and disengage the
force trim. A button on the cyclic disengages the force trim springs, allowing the cyclic and anti-torque pedals to
move freely without resistance. When re-engaged, the force trim springs hold the cyclic and pedals in their current
position and provide an increasing force gradient as the cyclic and/or pedals are deflected away from this
reference position.
Back-Up Control System (BUCS)
Normally, the Pilot and CPG flight controls are mechanically linked. The mechanical linkages are protected by
shear pins and mis-track sensors to prevent a control jam or severance from affecting both sets of flight controls.
If the flight controls are decoupled by the shear pin, or a mis-track is otherwise sensed, the Back-Up Control
System is automatically activated. The BUCS is a single-channel, four-axis, non-redundant electric fly-by-wire
(FBW) system. The FBW system is designed to replicate the feel of the hydromechanical controls but does not
replicate SCAS functionality.
BUCS can only be active for the Pilot or the CPG station. Either the Pilot or the CPG can transfer BUCS control to
their station if necessary, depending on the nature and location of the jam or severance within the flight controls.


Landing Gear
The AH-64D has two trailing-link, main landing gear wheels and a lockable, free-castoring tailwheel. The main
landing gear consists of two single wheels with integral disc brakes, mounted on separate nitrogen-oil shock
struts.

 Shock strut




 Foot steps




 WSPS deflector
 WSPS blades




Each anti-torque pedal is connected to a hydraulic disc brake on the corresponding main landing gear wheel.
Each brake is connected to its own master cylinder, which provides hydraulic pressure to the braking system.
The Pilot and CPG anti-torque pedals, when pressed downwards, actuate the hydraulic brake system for the
corresponding wheel. A parking brake valve maintains brake pressure when closed.
The tailwheel is free-castoring in a full 360° of rotation. A spring-loaded tailwheel lock can be hydraulically
 actuated to hold the tailwheel in its
 forward position. The tailwheel lock is
 WSPS guide vane activated from the Collective Flight Grips
 or the tail wheel lock pushbuttons.
 Both main landing gear shock struts have
 a one-time capability to absorb loads from
 a high-stress impact. Shear rings and
 rupture discs on each strut, when
 activated by a hard landing, start a
 controlled collapse of the strut to reduce
 crash loads on the airframe.
Fuel System
The AH-64D includes two internal self-sealing, crash-resistant fuel cells. The forward fuel cell holds up to 156
gallons, and the aft fuel cell holds up to 220 gallons. Fuel is normally balanced between the two cells automatically
by the avionics.
A 230-gallon ERFS external fuel tank can be mounted on each of the four stub wing pylons. The external fuel
tank mounted under the left inboard pylon feeds the forward fuel cell, and the external fuel tank mounted under
the right inboard pylon feeds the aft fuel cell. If an additional two fuel tanks are mounted under the outboard
pylons, the outboard external fuel tanks feed fuel to each respective inboard external fuel tank.
An Internal Auxiliary Fuel System (IAFS) may be installed into the ammunition bay, storing 100 gallons at the
expense of reducing the 1200 round ammunition capacity to 300 rounds.

Fuel Transfer Sub-system
Fuel is transferred between the forward and aft cells using pneumatic pressure. Transfer is normally automatic
but can be manually controlled by the aircrew.
Fuel transfer from the IAFS or external tanks is one-way only. Transfer from the external tanks to the internal
cells is pneumatic, and an electric fuel pump transfers fuel from the IAFS to the internal cells. If fuel is being
transferred between the forward and aft fuel cells, any fuel transfer from external or internal auxiliary fuel systems
will be paused.
Normally, the forward cell feeds engine 1 and the aft cell feeds engine 2. However, if necessary during abnormal
circumstances, the aircrew can manually select different crossfeed modes where both engines feed from one fuel
cell.
An electric boost pump is used to provide motive flow from the aft cell during engine start. This boost pump can
also be manually selected on during an emergency or operations in extreme cold temperatures. The APU has its
own electric boost pump that also draws from the aft cell.
Nitrogen Inerting Unit (NIU)
The fuel cells are inerted using nitrogen to reduce the risk of fire. The NIU is completely self-contained and
automatic. It uses aircraft power and pressurized air and generates an inerted mix containing around 99%
nitrogen. This inerted gas is used to pressurize the internal cells, to include the IAFS during fuel transfer, if the
IAFS is installed.


Electrical System
Electrical aircraft power is managed by the Electrical Power Management System (EPMS). The EPMS is a fully
redundant and automatic power system consisting of a distributor for battery, AC, and DC power.
The battery is a 24-volt, 15-amp fiber nickel-cadmium (FNC) design. It can provide power for normal flight loads
for up to 12 minutes, assuming at least an 80% charge.
AC power is provided by two brushless, air-cooled generators. Each generator outputs 45 kVA three-phase four-
wire power at 115 or 200 volts and 400 Hz. Each generator has its own Generator Control Unit (GCU). A single
generator is capable of handling full flight loads without shedding. The generators are mounted to the
transmission accessory gearbox, which is powered by the main transmission while at flight RPMs or the APU
during ground operations.
DC power is provided by two Transformer-Rectifier Units (TRUs), each providing 28 volts and 350 amps of DC
power. Like the generators, a single TRU can provide sufficient power for full flight loads without shedding.
Power is distributed by four AC busses, four DC busses, four battery busses, and a battery hot bus. Each bus and
power consumer is protected by a resettable circuit breaker.
An external power receptacle can provide DC and AC power for all systems from an Auxiliary Ground Power Unit
(AGPU).


Hydraulic System
The AH-64D has two independent hydraulic systems, labeled Primary and Utility. The Primary system exclusively
powers the hydraulic flight control system via the FMC and mechanical flight control linkages. It’s powered by the
main transmission and has a total capacity of six pints with a one-pint reservoir.
The Utility system is a secondary source of hydraulic power for the flight controls (bypassing the FMC), and
powers all other hydraulic systems: rotor brake, Area Weapon System turret drive, ammunition handling system,
APU start motor, tailwheel unlock actuator, and external weapon pylon elevation actuators. Because of the higher
loads placed on the utility system, it has a higher-volume manifold and larger reservoir.
The utility system also charges a 3,000-psi hydraulic accumulator. The hydraulic accumulator is used to provide
hydraulic damping during gun fire, hydraulic power to the APU starter, and can be used to temporarily power the
flight controls via the utility system in an emergency.
Both hydraulic systems are pressurized by a corresponding hydraulic pump powered by the transmission
accessory gearbox, which is powered by the main transmission while at flight RPMs or the APU during ground
operations.
Integrated Pressurized Air System (IPAS)
The IPAS provides pressurized air to aircraft pneumatic systems from engine bleed air. Bleed air is drawn from
two ports on each engine: a high-pressure port is exclusively used by each hydraulic pump, and a low-pressure
port is used by all other consumers. Low-pressure air is used by the engine air turbine starters, fuel boost and
transfer pumps, anti-ice system, ice detection probe, nitrogen inerting unit, vapor cycle cooling system, and
environmental control system.
IPAS bleed air can be provided by one or both engines, the APU, or an external source such as an AGPU.


Anti-Ice System
Ice detection is provided by an aspirating ice
detect probe, powered by pneumatic air from
the IPAS. The ice detect probe activates
whenever free air temperature drops to 5° C
or below. When the anti-ice system is in AUTO
mode, detection of ice will automatically
command activation of all anti-ice systems.
Ice protection is provided by engine inlet anti-
ice from main engine bleed air, electrical heat Ice Detect Probe
to the pitot and air data system (ADS) sensors,
electric sensor aperture anti-ice, and
electrically heated canopies.
The canopies also include crewmember-controllable windshield wipers and a defog system powered by the IPAS.




 WSPS guide vane




 WSPS guide vane
Environmental Control System (ECS)
The ECS provides avionics cooling via ventilation fans that force conditioned cooling air into each of the four
avionics bays. The ECS also provides crewmember comfort through ventilation, heating, and air conditioning.
Cockpit environmental control is provided via four gaspers installed in each crewstation, two over each shoulder
and another two mounted within the forward instrument panels.
Cockpit heating is provided by regulated bleed air from the IPAS.
Air conditioning is provided from two independent vapor cycle cooling systems. One system provides cooled air
for the Pilot and aft sections of each Extended Forward Avionics Bay (EFAB); the other system provides cooled
air for the CPG, the TADS and PNVS turrets, and the forward sections of each EFAB. A digital control unit (DCU)
manages the flow of cooled air for each system.




 ECS 1 system




 ECS 2 system




In the event of a failure of one of the ECS systems, the DCU of the functioning system will automatically open an
interconnect valve between the two cockpits. The ventilation fans in the failed cockpit will stop, and the functional
cockpit’s ventilation fans will force cooled air into both cockpits.
Lighting System
The AH-64D’s interior lighting consists of primary instrument lighting and secondary floodlights. The primary
lighting provides backlighting for all panels within the cockpit, such as switch labels, display bezels, and the
keypad. The floodlights are used to illuminate the main instrument panel and side consoles of each cockpit.
Each crewmember also has a dimmable utility light that can be aimed around the cockpit like a flashlight. The
standby instruments in the Pilot cockpit have their own independent lighting and, along with the utility light and
NVG-compatible floodlights, are powered by the battery in the event of a dual generator failure.
Exterior lighting consists of formation lights, navigation lights, anti-collision lights, and a steerable search and
landing light. The landing light is powered by the battery in the event of a dual generator failure.

Avionics
AH-64D avionics subsystems communicate across four redundant multiplex (MUX) bus channels at 1 Mbps. Each
bus channel consists of a primary and secondary bus. Channel 1 is used for controls and displays, communications
and transponder equipment, and aircraft systems. Channel 2 is used by the Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE),
Data Transfer Unit (DTU), flight controls, and navigation systems. Channel 3 is used by the sighting, sensors,
and weapons systems. Channel 4 is used exclusively by the Fire Control Radar (FCR) and Radar Frequency
Interferometer (RFI).




Avionics systems are controlled in both cockpits by Multi-Purpose Displays (MPDs), two per cockpit. Each MPD
has six variable-action buttons (VAB) per side. The buttons of the top row are labeled (left to right) T1–T6, the
bottom row B1–B6, and the left and right columns are labeled (top to bottom) L1–L6 and R1–R6, respectively.
Button B1, labeled “M”, returns the crewmember to the MPD Menu page. Each MPD also includes six fixed-action
buttons (FAB) that allow immediate access to the FCR, WPN, TSD, A/C, COM and VID pages; and a "favorites"
button that allows quick access of up to three frequently used MPD pages.
With external power connected and both throttles in the OFF position, the MPDs will enter a “screen saver” mode
after five minutes of inactivity. Pressing any MPD button will re-activate all MPDs.
Unlike most other aircraft, the AH-64D’s primary flight information is presented to the crewmembers through a
helmet-mounted display, in lieu of dedicated instruments or displays on the instrument panel. This not only frees
up the MPDs to display mission-, sensor-, or weapons-related data, it also ensures the crewmembers can monitor
the flight state of the aircraft while keeping their focus “heads out” of the cockpit, regardless of the direction they
may be looking.
Navigation System
The AH-64D’s navigation system consists of two Embedded GPS Inertial Navigation Systems (EGI), the Doppler
Radar Velocity Sensor (DRVS), radar altimeter, automatic direction finder (ADF), Helicopter Air Data System
(HADS), and Flight Management Computer (FMC).
Each EGI consists of a five-channel encrypted GPS receiver that provides position updates to a ring laser gyro
(RLG) inertial navigation unit (INU). The two EGIs are labeled INU1 and INU2, and the navigation system will
automatically select between each as either primary or backup.


 ADF receiver Radar altimeter transmitter


 Radar altimeter receiver




 GPS receiver
 Doppler velocity sensor




In addition, the AH-64D uses the AN/ASN-157 Doppler Radar Velocity Sensor (DRVS) as a velocity-aiding source
for the EGI. The DRVS uses Doppler radar measurements to determine aircraft ground speed and direction.
The AN/APN-209 Radar Altimeter provides height above ground level (AGL) to the navigation system. The APN-
209 uses a downward-facing radar transmitter and a separate receiver antenna to determine AGL altitude.
The AN/ARN-149 Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) provides audio and radio direction-finding capability for
transmissions between 100 and 2199.5 kHz.
 The Air Data System (ADS) consists of two
 independent air data subsystems: the Flight
 AADS probe Temperature probe
 Management Computer (FMC) and the
 Helicopter Air Data System (HADS). The HADS
 is comprised of the High Integrated Air Data
 Computer (HIADC) and two Airspeed And
 Direction Sensor (AADS) probes mounted to
 the engine nacelles. The AADS probes sense
 airspeed magnitude, direction, and free
 airstream temperature. The HIADC uses this
 data, along with ambient and pitot pressure
 sensors, to compute air mass related data.
 The FMC uses static and dynamic air pressures
measured from the static ports and pitot tubes to compute pressure altitude, air speed, and density altitude
related information. The FMC receives longitudinal and lateral true air speeds, static temperature, and non-filtered
true air speeds from the HIADC.
Communications System
The communications system includes an intercom for crewmember communication, an ARC-186(V) VHF-AM radio,
an ARC-164(V) UHF-AM radio, two ARC-201D VHF-FM radios, and an ARC-220 HF radio.




 VHF/FM1 “whip” antenna




 HF “towel bar” antenna




 FM2 “blade” antenna UHF “blade” antenna




The VHF radio can receive between 108.000 and 115.975 MHz and transmit/receive between 116.000 and
151.975 MHz. The VHF radio includes no frequency-hopping or encryption capability.
The UHF can transmit and receive between 225.000 and 399.975 MHz; and includes a separate GUARD receiver
tuned to 243.000 MHz. The radio is capable of HAVE QUICK and HAVE QUICK II frequency-hopping as an
electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) capability. A KY-58 is installed which facilitates voice and data
encryption for the UHF radio.
The two FM radios can transmit and receive between 30.000 and 87.975 MHz. The radios support SINCGARS
combat nets for frequency-hopping and include internal encryption for secure voice and data. The FM1 radio can
be augmented by an improved FM amplifier capable of providing up to 40 watts of transmit power for extending
the transmission range of the radio.
The HF radio can transmit and receive between 2.0000 and 29.9999 MHz and utilizes a KY-100 for voice and data
encryption.
The AH-64D includes an MD-1295A modem that can transmit and receive AFAPD (Air Force Applications Program
Development) messages over any radio except the ARC-220 HF radio, which has its own internal modem.
All radios are connected to the battery bus and can be utilized without generator power, but are limited to single-
channel radio frequencies that have been pre-loaded into the avionics.
Identification System
The AH-64D includes an APX-118(V) transponder, capable of responding to interrogations in Mode 1, Mode 2,
Mode 3/A, and Mode C formats. The APX-118(V) can also reply to encrypted Mode 4 interrogations.




 Upper transponder monopole antenna Lower transponder monopole antenna




Sensor and Sighting Systems
The primary sensor and sighting system for
the AH-64 is the Integrated Helmet And Integrated Helmet Unit
Display Sighting System (IHADSS). The
IHADSS consists of the Helmet Display Unit
(HDU), a small, collimated display placed in
front of the crewmember’s right eye (on a
rotatable arm); the Integrated Helmet Unit
(IHU) and Sensor Surveying Units (SSU), a Sensor Surveying Unit
series of sensors in the cockpit that determine
crewmember head position and line-of-sight;
 Helmet Display Unit
the Boresight Reticle Units (BRU), which
establishes sensor boresight; and avionics
systems that can slave sensor and weapon
systems to the IHADSS line of sight.
 The IHADSS displays sensor, targeting, and
 aircraft information in the crewmember’s
 AN/AAQ-11 M-PNVS turret line-of-sight, helping the crewmembers to
 locate and track targets and maintain
 situational awareness. The HDU symbology
 format changes depending on the display
 mode selected by the crew. The display is
 also capable of overlaying video from the
 PNVS or TADS sensors, augmenting the
 crewmembers’ view of terrain, obstacles,
 and targets at night or inclement weather.
 FLIR video for the Pilot comes from the
 AN/AAQ-11 Pilot Night Vision System
 (PNVS), which provides day- and night-
 capable infrared video.
The AN/ASQ-170 Target Acquisition Designation Sight (TADS) is an integrated target acquisition and tracking
system for the AH-64D’s Copilot/Gunner. It consists of both FLIR and Day TV (DTV) video systems, a laser
rangefinder/designator (LRF/D), and a laser spot tracker (LST). This gives the CPG the ability to locate, track,
and laser designate targets day and night, and in inclement weather conditions.




 AN/AAQ-11 M-PNVS turret




 AN/ASQ-170 M-TADS turret




Unique to the D model AH-64 is the AN/APG-78 Fire Control Radar (FCR) and AN/APR-48A Radar Frequency
Interferometer (RFI). The APG-78 is a millimeter-wave radar with the capability to detect and classify up to 256
air or ground targets. The radar is mounted atop the main rotor mast, allowing the helicopter to remain masked
while scanning for targets. It has a scan capability of ±45° in azimuth and ±25° in elevation, but can be rotated
±90° in azimuth to scan a sector to either side in air-to-ground mode, or a full 360° in air-to-air mode.



 AN/APG-78 FCR AN/APR-48A RFI




Along with the IHADSS and TADS, the FCR can be used as a source of targeting data for the 30mm Area Weapon
System, 2.75-inch unguided rockets, and AGM-114 Hellfire anti-tank missiles.
WEAPONS & MUNITIONS
The AH-64D was designed primarily to employ the Hellfire Modular Missile System (HMMS), along with its Area
Weapon System and Aerial Rocket Subsystem. It has four hardpoints, two mounted to each stub wing. Each
hardpoint is capable of articulating between +4° to -15° in elevation.


M139 Area Weapon System (AWS)
The Area Weapon System (AWS) consists of an M230 30mm
automatic chain-driven gun mounted on the underside of the
helicopter between the two main landing gear, its turret,
controls, and the ammunition handling system. The weapon is
mounted on a hydraulically steered turret that can be slaved to
the TADS line-of-sight, the IHADSS line-of-sight, or a fixed
forward-firing position. The turret can steer up to ±86° in
azimuth and can elevate up to +11° or depress down to -60°.
The M230 fires 30x113mm link-less, tracer-less ammunition at a rate of up to 625 rounds per minute. Ammunition
is stored in a magazine in the main fuselage under the transmission and can hold up to 1200 rounds. When the
Internal Auxiliary Fuel System (IAFS) is installed, magazine size is reduced to 300 rounds.
M788 Target Practice. The M788 is an inert training round used for target
practice. The M788 is ballistically matched to the M789 HEDP rounds.
M789 High Explosive/Dual Purpose. The M789 is a dual-purpose tactical
round used for combat operations. The round has a light armor penetrating
capability as well as a bursting fragmentation effect for anti-material and anti-
personnel use.


Aerial Rocket Sub-System (ARS)
The Aerial Rocket Sub-system consists of M261 lightweight
rocket launchers, capable of firing 2.75-inch folding fin aerial
rockets (FFARs), primarily variants of the Hydra-70 rocket
family. The M261 consists of 19 individual rocket tubes, and
may be loaded on all four pylons, for a maximum of 76 rockets.
Each M261 rocket launcher is "zoned", allowing for carriage of
up to three different rocket types with one pair of launchers
mounted, or up to five rocket types with two pairs of rocket
launchers mounted. Each tube includes individual firing and
fusing circuits.
The Hydra-70 rocket family is typically employed with the Mk 66 motor, with many different warhead options
available. Variants employed by the U.S. Army include the following:
M151 High Explosive. Also called the "10-pounder", the M151 is used
against lightly armored and soft targets. The warhead may be equipped with
the either M423 point-detonating (PD) fuze or the M433 resistance-
capacitance (RC) programmable delay fuze.
M229 High Explosive. Also called the "17-pounder", the M229 is used
as an enhanced “aerial artillery” warhead over the M151. The warhead
is equipped with the M423 point-detonating (PD) fuze. Minimum range:
140 meters.


M156 White Phosphorus. The M156 “Willie Pete” rocket is used for
target marking. The warhead is equipped with an M423 point-detonating
fuze for ground dispersal of the warhead’s effects, which generates a Not Implemented
white smoke marking signal for approximately 2 minutes (depending on
wind conditions). (N/I)


M264 Red Phosphorus. The M264 is used for generating smoke-
screen concealment. The warhead is equipped with an M439 variable
time delay fuze, which generates a white smoke concentration across Not Implemented
several hundred meters for approximately 5 minutes (depending on wind
conditions). (N/I)


M261 Multi-Purpose Sub-Munition. The MPSM contains 9
submunitions for use against lightly- to medium-armored vehicles and
soft targets. The warhead is equipped with an M439 variable time delay Not Implemented
fuze for an airburst just prior to the target. Minimum range 1,000 meters.
(N/I)


M255A1 Flechette. The “Flechette” contains 1,179 60-grain
hardened steel flechettes for use against soft targets or personnel. The
warhead is equipped with an M439 variable time delay fuze for an Not Implemented
airburst just prior to the target. Minimum range 800 meters; effective
range 1 to 3 kilometers. (N/I)


M257 Illumination. The “Overt Illum” is used for battlefield
illumination, and is equipped with an M442 fixed time fuze, which
will deploy a parachute-equipped flare approximately 3,500 meters
from its launch point. Provides illumination for approximately 3
minutes.


M278 IR Illumination. The M278 “Covert Illum” is used for covert
battlefield illumination, and is equipped with an M442 fixed time fuze,
which will deploy a parachute-equipped flare approximately 3,500 Not Implemented
meters from its launch point. Provides IR illumination for night vision
goggle-equipped personnel for approximately 3 minutes. (N/I)


M274 Training. Also called the "blue spear", the M274 training rocket
produces a brief smoke signature for target practice. An M423 point-
detonating (PD) fuze is integrated into warhead casing, which detonates
to provide a small, but noticeable flash and smoke signature for impact
spotting. This rocket is ballistically matched to the M151 HE rocket to
provide identical targeting and engagement training for aircrews.
Hellfire Modular Missile System (HMMS)
The Hellfire Modular Missile System is the primary weapon system
of the AH-64D. It can employ both semi-active laser-guided (SAL)
and active radar-guided (RF) variants of the AGM-114 Hellfire
missile. The system consists of the M299 four-rail missile launcher,
which can fire all variants of the Hellfire missile.
The Hellfire is an air-to-ground, anti-armor missile that has been
expanded in capability to include other air-to-surface applications.
The Hellfire is an effective standoff weapon which can be employed
as a direct- or indirect-fire weapon and can be fired from behind
cover or in the open. The Hellfire weighs approximately 100 lbs.
and has a 20-pound high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead,
which includes a tandem shaped-charge for defeating reactive armor.
Up to four Hellfires can be loaded on a single launcher, for a total of up to sixteen.
AGM-114K Laser-guided HEAT. The AGM-114K is a semi-active
laser-homing variant with both Lock-On Before Launch (LOBL) and
Lock-On After Launch (LOAL) capability. In LOBL mode, the Hellfire uses
a nose-mounted laser seeker to lock on to a coded laser designation
prior to launch. When launched in LOAL mode, the crew can select from
multiple trajectories that the missile will fly using a digital autopilot
system until it detects a laser designation mid-flight that matches its
assigned laser code.
AGM-114L Radar-guided HEAT. The AGM-114L is an active
radar-guided variant, making it a fire-and-forget weapon, and
retains LOBL and LOAL capability like its laser-guided predecessor.
In LOBL mode, the Hellfire uses an onboard millimeter wave
(MMW) radar seeker to lock on to the target prior to launch. In
LOAL mode, the Hellfire uses an inertial guidance system to fly to
the target location prior to acquiring the target with its MMW radar.


Auxiliary Fuel Systems (IAFS & ERFS)
The AH-64D can be equipped with auxiliary fuel systems to increase range and combat radius, extend endurance
at the objective area, or enable the AH-64D to self-deploy over long distances.
100-gallon Internal Auxiliary Fuel System (IAFS). The 100-gallon IAFS replaces the standard 1200-round
ammunition magazine for the Area Weapon System. The IAFS provides 98 gallons of usable fuel and storage for
up to 242 rounds of 30mm ammunition (300 rounds total). Like the main fuel tanks, the IAFS is crashworthy,
self-sealing if punctured by hostile fire, and nitrogen-inerted to prevent incendiary effects.
230-gallon Extended Range Fuel System
(ERFS). The 230-gallon ERFS tanks can be
mounted to the external wing stations. Unlike
the IAFS, the ERFS tanks do not have a fuel
quantity measurement system, but each ERFS
tank does have a sensor to indicate when the
tank itself is empty. In addition, the ERFS tanks
are not crashworthy or self-sealing, and are
typically only used for self-deployment.
However, on occasion these tanks may be used
in combat areas if absolutely necessary.
PILOT COCKPIT OVERVIEW
The Pilot’s primary task is to facilitate the Copilot/Gunner’s ability to operate the aircraft sensors and weapon
systems. The Pilot maintains awareness of the aircrew’s surroundings and the tactical situation; and maneuvers
the aircraft as necessary to ensure the Copilot/Gunner (CPG) can perform unimpeded sensor scans or employ
weapon systems.
The Pilot’s secondary task is to maintain security of the aircraft and aircrew. As the CPG will often be focused
inside the cockpit while operating the aircraft sensors, weapons, and radios, the Pilot maintains a “heads-out”
focus as much as possible. The Pilot remains on the look-out within the immediate vicinity around the aircraft
and is ready to employ the Area Weapon System (AWS) against close-in threats to protect the aircraft or other
team members if necessary.
When equipped with the mast-mounted Fire Control Radar (FCR), the Pilot can use the FCR to assist the CPG in
the targeting process by directing the CPG to specific areas within which to perform TADS sensor scans, or even
hand over individual targets to the CPG for engagement. Alternatively, the Pilot can use the FCR to autonomously
detect, acquire, and engage enemy targets with any of the aircraft’s three weapon systems.

Standby Magnetic Compass
The standby magnetic compass is used by the Pilot for heading reference
when there has been a failure of primary power, or the navigation system
has become unreliable.
Due to magnetic variances and other inaccuracies during normal flight
maneuvers, the standby magnetic compass should not be relied upon for
precise heading or navigation information. The aircraft should immediately
be recovered to a suitable friendly location. Visual landmarks may be used
to maintain awareness of aircraft position and aid in navigation back to
maintenance facilities or friendly-controlled areas.

Canopy Jettison Handle
The Canopy Jettison handle can be used to aid in emergency egress from
the aircraft. When initiated, the canopy side panels on either side of each
crewstation will be explosively jettisoned from the canopy frame. Either
crewmember can initiate the canopy jettison process, as can rescue crews
via an external jettison handle. (N/I)
Each of the three Canopy Jettison handles are physically locked in place via
a safety pin, which are stowed prior to flight. A stowage slot is present in
each crewstation for storing the safety pins during flight.

1. Bank Angle Scale. Indicates the bank angle when used in conjunction with the Bank Angle Indicator. A
 white triangular bank angle index is set at 0° of bank. Major tick marks are placed at 30°, 60° and 90°
 angles of bank. Minor tick marks are placed at 10° and 20° angles of bank.
2. Bank Angle Indicator. Indicates bank angle relative to the horizon. When the indicator is aligned with the
 fixed triangular bank angle index, the aircraft is in a level attitude.
3. Attitude Sphere. Rotates within the indicator to indicate pitch and roll attitude throughout most
 orientations of flight, in relation to the Aircraft Symbol. The white hemisphere indicates the aircraft nose is
 pointed above the horizon toward the sky, in a climb. The black hemisphere indicates the aircraft nose is
 pointed below the horizon toward the ground, in a dive.
4. Aircraft Symbol (Waterline). Provides a fixed attitude reference of the aircraft nose around which the
 Attitude Sphere rotates. The vertical alignment of the symbol can be manually adjusted by rotating the PULL
 TO CAGE knob.
5. Pitch Scale. Provides an attitude reference scale of aircraft pitch in relation to the Aircraft Symbol. Major
 tick marks are placed at every 10° of pitch and minor tick marks are placed at every 5° of pitch.
6. Slip Indicator (Ball). Indicates whether the aircraft is in coordinated flight. With the ball centered between
 the two black marks, the aircraft is in coordinated flight, which minimizes drag. If the ball is left of center,
 applying left pedal will adjust tail rotor thrust to bring the aircraft back into coordinated flight. Likewise, if
 the ball is right of center, applying right pedal will adjust tail rotor thrust to bring the aircraft back into
 coordinated flight.
7. Rate-of-Turn Indicator. Indicates the aircraft rate of turn, with the lower white bar moving left and right
 to indicate an increased turn rate in that direction. One bar width equates to 1° to 1.2° per second turn
 rate. If the lower white bar is aligned with the upper white bar in the center, the aircraft is not turning. If
 the lower white bar is aligned with the upper white bars on the left or right, the aircraft is in a standard rate,
 3° per second turn. If the lower white bar is centered between two of the upper white bars, the aircraft is
 in a half standard rate turn.
8. PULL TO CAGE Knob. Cages the attitude indicator and is used to adjust the relative pitch of the Aircraft
 Symbol in relation to the Attitude Sphere. When the knob is pulled outward, the Attitude Sphere is caged to
 a level attitude orientation regardless of the aircraft’s actual attitude, causing the OFF warning flag to appear.
 When pulled outward and rotated fully clockwise, the attitude indicator is locked in the caged position.
Standby Airspeed Indicator
The standby airspeed indicator is used by the Pilot
for airspeed reference when there has been a failure
of primary power, or the flight reference system has
become unreliable. The indicator is pneumatically 1. Airspeed Indicator
operated by the right pitot probe.
1. Airspeed Indicator. Indicates indicated
 airspeed along the Indicated Airspeed Scale.
2. Indicated Airspeed Scale. The outer scale
 of the instrument, from 0 to 250 knots. Tick 2. Indicated Airspeed Scale
 marks are set at 50-knot increments, and dots
 are set at 10-knot increments starting at 20
 knots.

Windshield Wiper Control Panel
Controls the external windshield wipers and canopy
defog functions.
1. DEFOG Button. Directs hot air mixed with ambient
 air from the cockpit against the canopy side panels
 to remove fogging. (N/I)
2. WINDSHIELD WIPER Knob. Sets the speed for
 the windshield wiper or returns the wiper to the
 PARK position. 1. DEFOG Button 2. WINDSHIELD WIPER Knob

 • PARK. Holding the knob in this position will move the windshield wiper to its designated parking
 location. When released, the knob will be spring-loaded to the OFF position.
 • OFF. Powers off the windshield wiper at its current position.
 • LO. Powers the windshield wiper and sets the motion to low speed.
 • HI. Powers the windshield wiper and sets the motion to high speed.


Parking Brake Handle
The PARK BRAKE handle can be used by the Pilot to set the wheel brakes without
needing to continuously apply pressure to the anti-torque pedals themselves. To
set the brakes using this method, the brakes are engaged by applying pressure
to the anti-torque pedals in either crewstation, and the Pilot then pulls the PARK
BRAKE handle out. The pressure on the anti-torque pedals is then released.
To release the brakes after they have been set using the PARK BRAKE handle,
either crewmember may simply apply brake pressure using the anti-torque
pedals, and the Parking Brake handle will snap inward.
Note that the PARK BRAKE handle can be pulled and locked in the outward
position without applying the wheel brakes, and therefore the outward position
of the handle does not directly correlate to the brakes being set. However, if the
PARK BRAKE handle is in the forward position, the brakes are indeed released.
Keyboard Unit
The Keyboard Unit (KU) is used by
the crewmembers to input data into
the aircraft computers, perform
arithmetic functions, or be used as
a scratchpad to temporarily record
data for a brief time.
Each Keyboard Unit is
independently operated by either
crewmember, and data is only
entered and utilized by the onboard
computers when a data prompt is
present on the KU display itself.
The N, E, S and W keys are boxed
for easy recognition if coordinates
are to be input using Latitude and
Longitude.




Data Entry and Arithmetic Functions
The KU uses an “overtype” method of data 1. Display Prompt 2. Scratchpad Display 3. Arithmetic Buttons

3. Arithmetic Buttons. If a display prompt is not present on the scratchpad display, basic arithmetic functions
 may be performed using these keys. To perform basic arithmetic, enter a number, followed by either the *
 (multiply), ÷ (divide), + (add), or - (subtract) keys. Enter another number and press Enter (equal). The
 resultant value will display on the scratch pad.
4. CLR Button. Removes all data entered on the scratchpad but will not remove or cancel a display prompt if
 present.
5. Scroll Arrows. Moves the cursor position left or right on the display to set the data entry point over existing
 characters.
6. ENTER Button. Used to accept a data input to an MPD data entry prompt. If data input is invalid, the
 characters on the scratchpad display will flash, and the data will need to be edited before it can be accepted
 into the MPD data prompt.
7. Display Brightness Knob. Adjusts the brightness of the KU scratchpad display.
8. BKS Button. Removes the character to the left of the cursor and shifts the cursor to the left, along with
 any characters underneath or to the right of the cursor.

 • LOCK. The rotor brake is
 commanded to engage in a
 high-pressure state to
 prevent the rotor from spinning. Used when performing an engine start in high winds or when on board
 a naval vessel in rough sea conditions.
 Rotor brake operation is electronically inhibited if either ENG POWER lever is beyond the IDLE position.
2. MSTR IGN Knob. Enables battery or external power to the aircraft.
 • OFF. Disconnects the battery from the DC battery bus.
 • BATT. Connects the battery to the DC battery bus. If the aircraft is receiving DC power from the
 Transformer-Rectifier Units (TRUs), the battery will be set to a charging state, but will automatically
 provide emergency power to the battery bus if a TRU failure occurs.
 • EXT PWR. Enables external AC and DC power to be supplied via the external power receptacle.
3. FRICT Lever. Adjusts the friction resistance when moving the engine power levers. (N/I)
4. APU Button. Intiates the APU automatic start-up and shutdown sequences.
 • ON Light. Illuminates to indicate when the APU has successfully started and is operating.
5. ENG START Switches. Controls the pneumatic air starters and ignition systems of each main engine.
 • START. Moving the switch momentarily to this position initiates an automatic start sequence for the
 respective engine and enables the engine ignitors. The System Processor (SP) will automatically
 activate the fuel boost pump and open the pneumatic valve to the engine air starter to spool the NG
 section of the engine. The SP will automatically close the pneumatic valve to disengage the starter
 when the NG reaches 52% RPM.
 • OFF. Normal position of the ENG START switch after initiating a START sequence or motoring the
 engine using the IGN ORIDE position.
 • IGN ORIDE. Moving the switch to this position manually opens the pneumatic valve to the engine air
 starters to spool the NG section of the engine. The System Processor (SP) will not activate the fuel
 boost pump nor the engine ignition system. The pneumatic air starters will continue to spool the N G
 section of the engine at ~25% RPM until the ENG START switch is returned to the OFF position, which
 will close the close the pneumatic valve to disengage the starter.
 An engine start sequence may be aborted by setting the ENG START switches to the IGN ORIDE
 position and then to OFF. This will disable the engine ignition system, disengage the engine air starters,
 and the fuel boost pump will be automatically deactivated by the SP.
6. ENG POWER Levers. Controls the fuel flow and control mode of each main engine. Each ENG POWER
 lever is connected to the corresponding Hydromechanical Unit (HMU) on the engine through the Power
 Available Spindle (PAS).
 Each ENG POWER lever includes a detent that prevents the lever from being inadvertantly advanced beyond
 FLY into the LOCK OUT range, or retarded below IDLE to OFF. A finger-lift detent lever on each ENG POWER
 lever disengages the mechanical detents.
 • LOCK OUT. Setting the ENG POWER lever to this position will lock out the Digital Electronic Control
 (DEC) from electronically regulating fuel flow and will set the engine throttle to fully open. This will also
 disable the NP overspeed protection and TGT limiting functions of the DEC, so the engine throttle will
 need to be manually controlled using the ENG POWER lever to prevent an overspeed or
 overtemperature condition.
 This position is only used during emergency procedures in which the DEC has malfunctioned or failed
 in some manner, requiring the aircrew to manually control the engine throttle in order to prevent an
 engine overspeed or overtemperature, or to maintain the rotor RPM (NR) within an acceptable range
 for flight.
 • FLY. Setting the ENG POWER lever to this position will set the PAS to the FLY position and command
 the DEC to trim fuel flow to maintain the rotor RPM (NR) at 101%. Each engine will automatically
 regulate their respective throttle settings to equally balance the torque requirement between each
 engine (load-sharing).
 • IDLE. Setting the ENG POWER lever to this position will set the PAS to the IDLE position. The DEC will
 no longer regulate the fuel flow based on rotor RPM (NR) and the load-sharing logic between the
 engines is disabled.
 Setting the ENG POWER lever to this position will also reset the DEC from the LOCK OUT condition,
 returning DEC-related functionality to the respective engine.
 • OFF. Setting the ENG POWER lever to this position will set the PAS to the OFF position, shutting off
 fuel flow to the engine.
 When the RTR BRK switch is in the BRK or LOCK positions, the ENG POWER levers will be physically inhibited
 from advancing beyond the IDLE position.

COPILOT/GUNNER COCKPIT OVERVIEW
The Copilot/Gunner’s primary task is to utilize the aircraft sensors to continuously search, acquire, identify, and
(when appropriate) engage targets on the battlefield with the aircraft’s weapon systems. When enemy targets
are located and identified, the Copilot/Gunner (CPG) coordinates with the Pilot (PLT) to determine the best course
of action to accomplish the mission. Effective communication and coordination between the crewmembers are
critical to mission success.
The CPG’s secondary task is to manage the aircraft navigation and communication systems during the mission.
As the Pilot will often be focused on flying the aircraft and maneuvering around the terrain and obstacles, the
CPG will typically be focused inside the cockpit to tune radio frequencies, monitor the aircraft movement along
the current route, and receive or transmit tactical reports. Accordingly, the CPG coordinates with other units, to
include ground forces, or the other Copilot/Gunners within the team to delineate sectors of fire, sensor coverage,
and fires distribution on enemy targets.
The CPG can effectively utilize any sensor on the aircraft to search for or engage enemy targets. While the Pilot
can assist in the targeting process by using the FCR to hand over targets to the Copilot/Gunner, the CPG can also
directly control the FCR, and may autonomously hand over targets between the FCR and the TADS. If necessary,
the CPG may even hand over a TADS target to the Pilot for an engagement using the FCR, while the CPG continues
to scan the battlefield for additional targets with the electro-optical sensors in the TADS.

Power Quadrant Panel
The ENG POWER levers in the Copilot/Gunner cockpit
function identically to those located on the Pilot’s Power

The CPG’s ENG POWER levers are connected to the
Pilot’s ENG POWER levers through linkages between the
cockpits. When either crewmember moves an ENG
POWER lever, the corresponding lever in the other
cockpit will move accordingly.
However, the CPG’s finger-lift detent levers are not
mechanically linked to the physical detents of the Pilot’s
ENG POWER levers. The detent levers on the ENG
POWER levers in the CPG cockpit use microswitches to
electrically command the detents in the Pilot cockpit. As
such, the electrical power is required for the CPG to
physically move the ENG POWER levers beyond the
LOCK OUT or IDLE detents.

TADS Electronic Display And Control (TEDAC)
The TEDAC is a modernized replacement for the Optical Relay Tube (ORT) from the AH-64A and early AH-64D
aircraft. Its primary purpose is to present the CPG with high-resolution sensor video from the Modernized Target
Acquisition Designation Sight (M-TADS).


 TEDAC Display Unit (TDU)




 TEDAC Left Handgrip (LHG) TEDAC Right Handgrip (RHG)



Along with the TDU bezel controls, fixed handgrips on either side of the TEDAC are used to control aircraft
sensors, weapons, and the CPG’s MPD cursor. Many of these controls replicate functions on the CPG’s cyclic and
collective controls but allow the CPG to utilize such functions without actively interfering with the Pilot’s flight
control inputs.
The TEDAC can also be used to display the FCR page as an alternative to an MPD. However, since the TEDAC
does not have Variable Action Buttons along the bezel of its display, the bezel FCR controls may only be utilized
using the left handgrip cursor controller.
Each text box above may be selected to jump to a more detailed description of that TEDAC component. Selecting
the image of the component will return the manual back to this page.
TEDAC Display Unit (TDU)
The TEDAC Display Unit provides the CPG with a “heads-out” display for presenting TADS or PNVS sensor video,
or FCR targeting information. The TDU will display sensor video in a grayscale format when the TDU Display Knob
is set to DAY mode, or in a greenscale format when the Display Knob is set to NT mode.

 • TV (Center). Sets the TADS sensor video to the DTV camera.
 • DVO (Aft). No function.
5. Weapon Action Switch (WAS). Selects, or “actions”, a weapon system for employment. (Also known as
 “WASing”, pronounced “Wahz-ing”). Selecting the same weapon a second time will de-select, or “de-action”,
 the weapon. If the Copilot/Gunner actions a weapon from the TEDAC Left Handgrip (LHG), only the weapon
 trigger on the LHG will be activated for weapons employment from the CPG station.
 Neither crewstation has priority over the other, allowing either cyclic Weapon Action Switch to action the
 weapon, taking control away from the other crewstation in a “last actioned” logic.
 • GUN (Forward). Actions/de-actions the Area Weapon System (AWS) for employment and slaves the
 gun to the weapon solution of the selected sight within the crewstation.
 • RKT (Left). Actions/de-actions the Aerial Rocket Sub-system (ARS) for employment, activates pylon
 articulation, and displays the Rocket Steering Cursor symbology within the crewstation.
 If the CPG actions rockets using the Weapon Action Switch on the LHG and the Pilot actions rockets,
 the crew will enter COOP (Cooperative) rocket mode.
 If the CPG actions rockets using the Weapon Action Switch on the CPG cyclic and the Pilot actions
 rockets, the rockets will be assigned to either crewstation using the “last actioned” logic.
 • MSL (Right). Actions/de-actions the Hellfire Modular Missile System (HMMS) for employment,
 activates pylon articulation, and displays the Missile Launch symbology within the crewstation.
 • ATA (Aft). No function.
 NOTE: Weapons cannot be actioned if the aircraft is weight-on-wheels unless GND ORIDE has been enabled
 on the Armament Panel to override this inhibit.
6. Store/Update Switch. Stores new target or waypoint locations using the CPG’s selected sight or performs
 a position update to the aircraft navigation system.
 • Store Point (STORE, Forward). When the CPG’s selected sight is TADS, moving the switch
 momentarily to this position stores a Target (TG) point along the TADS line-of-sight at the current
 range.
 When the CPG’s selected sight is FCR, moving the switch momentarily to this position stores a Target
 (TG) point at the location of the Next-To-Shoot (NTS) target.
 When used in conjunction with the TSD Point sub-page, may be used to store a Waypoint (WP) or

INTEGRATED HELMET AND DISPLAY
SIGHTING SYSTEM (IHADSS)
The IHADSS allows the crewmembers to view flight and navigation information, sensor video, targeting
information, and weapon status. The IHADSS also allows each crewmember to independently cue weapons and
sensors using their head movements. The system is an integral part of flight operations during the day, and a
crucial system in performing flight operations at night.


 IHU tracking sensors Integrated Helmet Unit (IHU)




 Sensor Surveying Unit
 Sensor Surveying Unit




 HDU Combiner Lens

 Helmet Display Unit (HDU)




As a subcomponent of the IHADSS, each crewmember’s individual Helmet Display Unit (HDU) projects symbology
and video onto a combiner lens directly in front of the crewmembers’ right eye. Similar to a Heads-Up Display
(HUD) found in many other aircraft types, the HDU is the primary source of flight and navigation data for the
crewmember that is on the controls. However, unlike many HUD designs that are fixed to an aircraft’s instrument
panel, the HDU in the AH-64 is designed to allow a crewmember to view and effectively utilize this data without
requiring them to focus their attention straight ahead over the nose of the aircraft.
Symbology is displayed within the crewmember HDU’s in one of two formats: Flight symbology or Weapon
symbology. Weapon symbology is displayed within the CPG’s HDU when the CPG’s selected sight is TADS.
(See TADS Weapon Symbology for more information.)


Flight Symbology
The Pilot is always presented with Flight symbology within the HDU. The Copilot/Gunner (CPG) is presented with
Flight symbology within the HDU when the CPG’s selected sight is HMD, or any time the CPG’s NVS Mode is set
to NORM or FIXED. Flight symbology is presented to the crewmembers in one of four symbology modes: Cruise,
Transition, Hover, or Bob-Up. The Symbology Select Switch on either Cyclic Grip is used to change the selected
symbology mode for both crewstations simultaneously.

 increments and marked by a cardinal direction or heading in the tens value. Minor tick marks are displayed
 in 10° increments.
2. Aircraft Heading. Displays a digital readout of the aircraft’s current magnetic heading in 1° increments,
 superimposed over the Heading Tape.
3. Lubber Line. The Lubber Line is aligned to the centerline of the aircraft and serves as a reference for both
 the aircraft heading and for the Bank Angle Indicator when in Cruise symbology mode.
4. Engine Torque. Displays the highest torque value of the two engines, in 1% increments. A box will be
 displayed around the torque at 98% or greater. If the difference in engine torque values exceeds 12%, the
 torque digital readout will flash.
5. Horizon Line. Indicates the horizon position and orientation relative to the aircraft nose, which is referenced
 to the LOS Reticle.
 When in Cruise symbology mode, the the Horizon Line is displaced in pitch in a 2:1 movement ratio.
 When in Transition symbology mode, the Horizon Line is displaced in pitch in a 4:1 movement ratio, up to
 a maximum of ±30°. When aircraft pitch attitude exceeds ±30° in pitch, the Transition mode Horizon Line
 will remain saturated at maximum deflection until the pitch attitude is less than ±30°.
6. Head Tracker. Represents the armament datum line (ADL, or centerline) of the aircraft; 0° in azimuth and
 -4.9° in elevation. The Head Tracker assists the crewmembers in maintaining awareness of their head
 position relative to the nose of the aircraft, especially under low-light conditions while using the PNVS or
 TADS sensors for flight and navigation.
7. True Airspeed. Indicates the true airspeed (TAS) of the aircraft in 1 knot increments, from 0 to 210 knots.
 The airspeed indication is boxed if the airspeed exceeds VNE.
 When Attitude Hold is engaged, a rounded “status window” box is displayed around the TAS digital readout.
8. Pitch Ladder. Indicates aircraft pitch attitude when in Cruise symbology mode. Pitch ladder increments are
 displayed at ±10°, ±20°, ±30°, ±45° and ±60° pitch.
9. Waypoint Status. Displays the point selected for navigation, its distance in
 kilometers or nautical miles, and estimated time enroute (ETE). The ETE is based
 on the current ground speed and distance remaining, and is presented in HH:MM
 format when the ETE is ≥5 minutes, or M:SS format when ETE is <5 minutes.
 The ETE is not displayed when ground speed is <15 knots or ETE is >10 hours.
 Waypoint Status information is not displayed if there is no active destination point.
10. Ground Speed. Indicates the speed across the surface in 1 knot increments. Ground Speed is only displayed
 in Cruise and Transition symbology modes, and only when the primary INU is aligned.
11. Bank Angle Indicator. Indicates bank angle relative to the horizon when in Cruise symbology mode. When
 the Bank Angle Indicator is aligned with the lubber line below the heading tape, the aircraft is in a level
 attitude.
12. Barometric Altitude. Indicates the barometric altitude when Cruise mode symbology is displayed.
 Barometric Altitude is displayed in 10-foot increments from -2,300 feet to 20,000 feet.
13. Flight Path Vector. The Flight Path Vector (FPV) represents the point towards which the helicopter is
 flying. It is a 3-dimensional representation of the aircraft’s velocity vector. The FPV is not displayed in Hover
 or Bob-Up symbology modes, if the 3-dimensional velocity is <5 knots ground speed, or if the aircraft is
 weight-on-wheels.
14. Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI). The Vertical Speed Indicator moves up and down the rate-of-climb scale
 to indicate vertical speed. The VSI becomes saturated at the ±1,000 fpm tick marks at the top or bottom of
 the Rate-of-climb Scale, augmented by digital readouts of rate-of-climb in 100 fpm increments.
15. Rate-of-climb Scale. Major tick marks are placed at 0, ±500 and ±1,000 feet per minute (fpm) rates of
 climb/descent. Minor tick marks are placed in 100 fpm increments between 0 and ±500 fpm. When the rate-
 of-climb/descent exceeds ±1,000 fpm, a digital readout to the nearest 100 fpm value is displayed adjacent
 to the 1,000 fpm major tick marks.
 When Altitude Hold is engaged, a rounded “homeplate” box is displayed next to the Rate-of-climb Scale at
 0 fpm.
16. Radar Altitude. Indicates the radar-detected altitude above ground level from 0 to 1,428 feet. The Radar
 Altitude is displayed in increments of 1 foot from 0 to 50 feet in altitude, and increments of 10 feet between
 50 feet and 1,428 feet in altitude.
 The Radar Altitude is not displayed when the altitude exceeds 1,428 feet above ground level.
17. Skid/Slip Indicator. Also called the “trim ball”; indicates whether the aircraft is in coordinated flight (also
 known as “in aerodynamic trim”, or simply “in trim”). With the ball is centered between the tick marks, the
 aircraft is in coordinated flight, which minimizes drag. If the ball is left of center, applying left pedal will
 adjust tail rotor thrust to bring the aircraft back into coordinated flight. Likewise, if the ball is right of center,
 applying right pedal will adjust tail rotor thrust to bring the aircraft back into coordinated flight.
18. Command Heading. Indicates the magnetic heading to the Navigation Fly-To Cue when in Cruise,
 Transition, or Hover symbology modes. When Bob-up symbology mode is entered, the Command Heading
 chrevron is set to the heading of the aircraft, and maintained at that value until Bob-Up mode is exited.
19. Engine TGT. Displays the highest of the two engines’ Turbine Gas Temperature (TGT) indications if
 operating in an intermediate or contingency TGT limit.
 When operating under dual engine intermediate power, the TGT (in °C) will be displayed during the final
 two minutes of either the 30-minute or 10-minute allowable timers.
 When operating under single engine contingency power, the TGT (in °C) will be displayed during the entire
 2.5 minutes allowable for operating in the contingency power temperature range.
20. Line-Of-Sight (LOS) Reticle. Indicates the crewmember’s helmet line-of-sight (LOS). The LOS Reticle is
 used as a positional reference for the Head Tracker, Horizon Line, Velocity Vector, Acceleration Cue, and
 Bob-Up Box. It is also used as an aiming crosshair for weapons employment, and is bolded when in Cruise
 symbology mode.
 The LOS Reticle flashes when the crewmember’s LOS is invalid, the selected NVS sensor is at its slew limit,
 or if the gun is actioned and the gun system has failed and is no longer following the crewmember’s helmet.
21. Navigation Fly-To Cue. Indicates the location of the current point selected for navigation. Also called the
 “homeplate” symbol, the Navigation Fly-To Cue is sized so the Flight Path Vector fits within it for precise 3-
 dimensional navigation.
 The Navigation Fly-To Cue is not displayed when the aircraft is weight-on-wheels.
22. G Status. Displays the accelerometer measured G-force on the aircraft when the load factor exceeds 2G’s,
 or if within ¼G of the G load factor limit under the current conditions of velocity, density altitude, and gross
 weight.
23. Field-Of-View (FOV) Box. The FOV box indicates the relative position of the crewmember’s helmet line-
 of-sight within the larger Field-of-Regard box. The FOV box represents a 30° x 40° field of view and is driven
 by the crewmember’s helmet orientiation as detected by helmet sensors within each resepective cockpit.
24. Field-Of-Regard (FOR) Box. The FOR box indicates azimuth limits for the crewmember’s Night Vision
 System (NVS) sensor turret. The format of the FOR box is determined by the NVS sensor (PNVS or TADS)
 assigned to that crewstation. Tick marks around the edges of the PNVS FOR box mark 0° in azimuth and
 elevation. Tick marks around the edges of the TADS FOR box mark 0° and ±90° in azimuth, and 0° elevation.

25. Alternate Sensor Bearing. Indicates the magnetic heading of the opposite crewmember’s selected sight
 when the opposite crewmember’s sight is HMD or TADS.
 The Alternate Sensor Bearing symbol is not displayed when the other crewmember’s selected sight is FCR.
26. Cued Line-Of-Sight Reticle. Indicates the virtual location of the crewmember’s selected acquisition
 source.
 If CUEING is deselected on the Pilot’s WPN Utility (UTIL) sub-page, this symbol is not displayed.
27. Cueing Dots. Indicates the quadrant direction of the selected acquisition source to “cue” the crewmember’s
 helmet position to the location of the Cued LOS Reticle. The dots are removed when the Cued LOS Reticle
 is with 4° of that quadrant relative to the LOS Reticle.
 All four dots flash when the “IHADSS B/S REQUIRED” message is present within the Sight Status field of the
 High Action Display, indicating the crewmember needs to boresight their IHADSS.
 If CUEING is deselected on the Pilot’s WPN Utility (UTIL) sub-page, these dots are not displayed.
28. Cued Line-Of-Sight Dot. Indicates the relative location of the selected acquisition source within the Field-
 of-Regard box.
29. Acceleration Cue. The Acceleration Cue indicates magnitude and direction of the aircraft’s rate of
 acceleration. The Acceleration Cue is displayed in Transition, Hover, and Bob-Up symbology modes.
 When in Transition mode, or in Hover or Bob-Up modes when the ground speed is <6 knots, the Acceleration
 Cue is displaced from the outer point of the Velocity Vector. When in Hover or Bob-Up modes and the
 Velocity Vector becomes “saturated” at 6 knots ground speed, the Acceleration Cue displacement originates
 from the center of the LOS reticle.
30. Velocity Vector. The Velocity Vector indicates the aircraft’s 2-dimensional direction and magnitude of
 velocity across the surface.
 In Hover and Bob-Up symbology modes, the Velocity Vector will become “saturated” (reaching it’s maximum
 displacement) at 6 knots ground speed. In Transition symbology mode, the Velocity Vector will become
 saturated at 60 knots ground speed.
31. Radar Altimeter Tape. The Radar Altimeter Tape displays altitude above ground level in an “analog”
 format. Major tick marks are displayed in 50-foot increments between 0 and 200 feet. Minor tick marks are
 displayed in 10-foot increments between 0 and 50 feet.
 When the aircraft has exceeded 200 feet AGL, the Radar Altimeter Tape will be removed from the symbology.
 The Radar Altimeter Tape will not be subsequently displayed until the aircraft descends below 180 feet AGL.
32. Bob-Up Box. The Bob-Up Box represents a 12-foot wide octogonal box anchored to a position on the
 surface below the helicopter.
 When Bob-Up symbology mode is entered, the Bob-Up Box is displayed and referenced to the 2-dimensional
 position on the surface the helicopter was located over when Bob-Up mode was entered. This is termed
 “dropping a Bob-Up box”. The box will remain in this position until the crew changes symbology modes.
 As the aircraft moves laterally across the surface, the Bob-Up Box moves within the symbology to indicate
 the relative position of the reference location. When the Bob-Up box has become “saturated” (reaching it’s
 maximum displacement), the aircraft has displaced 40 feet from the reference position on the surface. Once
 the aircraft returns to within 40 feet of the reference position, the Bob-Up Box will become de-saturated.
33. High Action Display. The High Action Display is displayed in both Flight and Weapons symbology. The
 HAD provides prioritized sight and weapon status messages to the crew for targeting and weapons
 employment. (See High Action Display in the Helmet-Mounted Display chapter for more information.)


Symbology Categories
Symbology elements can be grouped into one of four categories: Informational elements, Longitudinally scaled
elements, Laterally scaled elements, and Virtual elements.

Informational Symbology Elements
Symbology elements that provide data and status indications are fixed in location within the symbology. Some of
these elements are only displayed in specific symbology modes, such as Ground Speed and Barometric Altitude.
Other elements are only displayed when relevant; or when approaching an aircraft limitation, such as the G Status
or Turbine Gas Temperature (TGT) indications.

 Informational Symbology Elements
Longitudinally Scaled Symbology Elements
Symbology elements that are longitudinally scaled include the Horizon Line, Pitch Ladder, Bank Angle Indicator,
Skid/Slip Indicator, Vertical Speed Indicator and Rate-of-climb Scale, and the Heading Tape along with its
associated azimuth indicators. These symbology elements can be thought of as representing a front-facing
viewpoint from behind the helicopter, or as the IHADSS equivalent of the MPD FLT page.

 Laterally Scaled Symbology Elements
Virtual Symbology Elements
Virtual symbology elements include the Flight Path Vector, Head Tracker, Cued LOS Reticle, and Navigation Fly-
To Cue. These symbology elements are displayed at their true positions relative to the crewmember’s line-of-
sight, as virtual representations of locations “out-the-window”. As the crewmember turns his or her head, the
positions of these symbols are updated within the symbology field-of-view in real-time so they reflect the true
positions of their respective sources.




 Navigation Fly-To Cue Flight Path Vector




 Head Tracker Cued LOS Reticle




 Virtual Symbology Elements

When C-Scope is enabled within the crewstation, FCR target data will also be displayed as virtual symbology
elements.
Night Vision System (NVS)
The IHADSS integrates the use of a Night Vision System
(NVS) mode for flight operations at night. Each
crewmember can enable a FLIR video underlay within
their respective HDU by setting the NVS Mode switch in
their crewstation to NORM or FIXED.
(See Tail Wheel/NVS Mode Panel for more information.)
By default, the PNVS is assigned to the Pilot crewstation and the TADS assigned to the CPG crewstation, but
either crewmember can take control of either NVS sensor by using the NVS Select switch on the Collective Flight
Grip. This can be especially critical in the case of a failure in the NVS system while operating at extremely low
altitudes at night. (See Collective Flight Grip for more information.)
When the NVS Mode switch is set to NORM, the NVS sensor assigned to the crewstation will unstow if necessary
and become slaved to the crewmember’s helmet line-of-sight. If the crewmember’s helmet reaches or exceeds
the slew limits of their NVS sensor, the LOS Reticle will flash and “LIMITS” will be displayed within the Sight
Status field of the High Action Display.
When the NVS Mode switch is set to FIXED, the NVS sensor assigned to the crewstation will slave to the fixed
forward location (0° in azimuth/-4.9° elevation). This can be used in the case of a failure in the IHADSS helmet
tracking, which will result in the sensor turret remaining at its last commanded position. If this were to occur, the
last detected helmet position may be off to one side or at an extreme look-down angle, preventing the
crewmember from viewing the aircraft’s current flight path and any imminent obstacles.
When the NVS is set to NORM or FIXED, virtual symbology elements within the HDU become “video-stabilized”.
This is to reduce visual disorientation if the crewmember rotates their head faster than the NVS turret can slew.
If this occurs, virtual elements such as the Flight Path Vector will remain stabilized to their relative locations within
the FLIR video, to prevent a false perception of the aircraft’s flight path within the FLIR imagery.
The exception to this logic is the Head Tracker symbol, which will always remain “helmet-stabilized” to the
crewmember’s line-of-sight, even when the NVS is in FIXED mode.




 PNVS at its turret limit
AN/AAQ-11 Pilot Night Vision System (PNVS)
The PNVS is a Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor housed within a steerable turret on the topside of the
aircraft nose sensor assembly. The PNVS is primarily intended to aid the Pilot in performing low-altitude flight
under any lighting conditions, ranging from twilight to total darkness without ambient lighting from celestial or
terrestrial light sources.
The PNVS can slew ±90° in azimuth and +20° to -45° in elevation, at up to 120° per second. As the crewmember
moves his or her head, the IHADSS sensors within the cockpit track the movements of the helmet and translate
those motions into steering commands. As the crewmember looks left or right, the PNVS turret slews left and
right to follow. As the crewmember looks up or down, the FLIR sensor itself articulates up and down within the
turret housing.
The Modernized PNVS (M-PNVS) includes an enlarged sensor housing with a second optical sensor aperture for
potential upgrades and “growth” within the system.




 PNVS Sensor Turret Slew Range
AN/ASQ-170 TADS as Night Vision System
The TADS is a multi-sensor targeting system housed within a steerable turret on the underside of the aircraft
nose sensor assembly. The TADS is primarily intended to allow the Copilot/Gunner to target and designate enemy
locations and vehicles for the aircraft’s weapon systems. Like the PNVS, the TADS includes a Forward-Looking
Infrared (FLIR) sensor. Unlike the PNVS, the TADS FLIR sensor is intended for targeting purposes, and includes
three levels of optical magnification. However, if required, the TADS FLIR can be used as an NVS sensor for the
Copilot/Gunner, or as a backup NVS sensor for the Pilot (should the PNVS fail).
The TADS can slew ±120° in azimuth and +30° to -60° in elevation, at up to 60° per second. As the crewmember
moves his or her head, the IHADSS sensors within the cockpit track the movements of the helmet and translate
those motions into steering commands. As the pilot looks around, the TADS turret rotates in azimuth and elevation
to follow. However, due to the slower slew rate of the TADS, the crewmember must be more deliberate when
moving his or her head to avoid “outrunning the TADS” and inducing visual disorientation.
If the CPG is using the TADS for targeting as their selected sight and moves their NVS Mode switch to NORM or
FIXED, their sight selection will automatically switch to HMD, the TADS video will switch to FLIR (overriding the
TADS Sensor Select switch on the TEDAC Left Handgrip), the TADS Field-Of-View will switch to Wide, and the
TADS will be slaved to the CPG’s helmet position.
If the Pilot’s NVS Mode switch is in NORM or FIXED and the Pilot presses forward on the NVS Select Switch, the
same events will occur, except the TADS turret will be slaved to the Pilot’s helmet position.




 TADS Sensor Turret Slew Range
ENHANCED UP-FRONT DISPLAY (EUFD)
The Enhanced Up-Front Display (EUFD) provides the aircrew with a consolidated location for viewing critical
message alerts about aircraft systems and managing voice and data communications. Unlike the MPDs, the EUFD
functionality is retained when the aircraft is operating on battery power.
The display itself is divided into three primary areas: warnings/cautions/advisories (WCA), radio status, and
information display. Additional controls for interacting with and controlling the EUFD are located to either side of
the LED display.

1. Warning/Caution/Advisory (WCA) Scroll Rocker. Accesses additional WCA messages by scrolling the
 WCA areas up or down in a scrolling manner. This may be necessary if 8 or more messages exist in any of
 the three WCA columns. A double arrowhead symbol is displayed along the EUFD display if any column
 contains 8 or more active message alerts to indicate to the crew that WCA scrolling is necessary to view all
 messages.
2. Warning Message Area. Warning messages alert the crew to critical aircraft emergencies or malfunctions
 that could result in death to the aircrew and/or catastrophic loss of the aircraft. These emergency conditions
 will be accompanied by the flashing illumination of the MSTR WARN pushbutton light and an audio voice
 message alerting the crew to the nature of the emergency.
 Examples of warning alerts include an engine fire, an engine flameout, or a total loss of hydraulics.
3. Caution Message Area. Caution messages alert the crew to less critical but potentially hazardous aircraft
 malfunctions or conditions that could affect safe flight operations. These conditions will be accompanied by
 the illumination of the MSTR CAUT pushbutton light and an audio caution tone to the crew.
 Examples of caution alerts include a loss of oil or transmission pressure, overtemperature conditions, failures
 in the electrical system, or low fuel levels.
4. Advisory Message Area. Advisory messages alert the crew to non-critical conditions, status of systems,
 or reception of datalink transmissions. Some messages may be accompanied by unique audio tones to cue
 the crew to their presence.
 Examples of advisory alerts include the commanded state of the tail wheel lock (when weight-on-wheels),
 completion of an automatic fuel check, or an unlatched canopy door.
5. Brightness Control Knob. Adjusts the brightness of the EUFD display.
6. Preset Button. Toggles display of the Preset frequency list. (See Tuning a Radio using the EUFD for more
 information.)

 the EUFD stopwatch in one crewstation will have no effect on the EUFD stopwatch in the other crewstation.
13. Swap Button. Swaps the radio frequency, encryption mode, and network configuration with the standby
 values of the currently selected radio.
MULTI-PURPOSE DISPLAYS (MPD)
The revised cockpit and avionics of the AH-64D were designed to provide an efficient pilot interface, through
which the human factors were heavily considered to optimize cockpit workflow, known as MANPRINT. The
predominant means of facilitating this interface is through two Multi-Purpose Displays (MPD) within each
crewstation, and incorporating a “management by exception” principle within the avionics:
 • Most aircraft systems are managed automatically without aircrew interaction by default; but may be
 monitored or managed directly by the aircrew if necessary.
 • Information that is not relevant to the current task, conditions, or mode is not presented to the aircrew.
 • Information that is of critical importance to the aircrew is displayed automatically without crewmember
 action, also known as auto-paging.
 • Functions or commands that would create a conflict between crewstations or would otherwise interfere
 with the current task are disabled or inhibited, also known as “barriered”.
The MPDs themselves are 6 × 6 inch color liquid crystal displays that allow the Pilot and CPG to independently
access different functions or view different elements of information. There are two identical MPDs in each
crewstation. Functions that would otherwise be controlled by switches or physical controls in other aircraft are
accessed through the MPDs in the AH-64D.
If on external power, weight-on-wheels, and the Power Levers are set to OFF, the MPDs will enter a screensaver
mode if no buttons are pressed within 5 minutes. Pressing a button on either MPD will re-initialize the MPDs.

 • Menu page: If any page is displayed on the MPD other than the Menu page, this button will display
 the Menu page.
 • DMS page: If the Menu page is displayed on the MPD, this button will access the DMS page.


MPD Paging
The MPD Fixed Action Buttons and the Menu page provide immediate access to most aircraft systems
or information. Upon pressing any Fixed Action Button or selection of any page option from the Menu
page, the MPD will display the requested page, which will be denoted by the text displayed above the
M button (VAB B1). If this text is boxed, the MPD is displaying the corresponding parent, or “top-
level”, page. If the text is un-boxed, a sub-page has been accessed from the parent page.
Sub-page options are denoted by a right-facing arrow placed above the text of the sub-page option.
When the first sub-page level is accessed, the corresponding sub-page text becomes boxed, removing
the box from the parent page text above the M button (VAB B1). If a second sub-page level is accessed
from the first sub-page, the second sub-page text becomes boxed, with the first sub-page text boxed
in a “partial-intensity” green.
Some MPD pages include options to display the existing page in a different format, which presents
different elements of information on the current page. Format options differ in appearance from sub-
page options in that a right-facing arrow is not displayed above the corresponding text.
An example of this distinction can be seen on the Weapon (WPN) page below. Five sub-page options
are displayed along the top row of Variable Action Buttons, whereas three additional WPN page
formats may be selected along the bottom row.




 Sub-page options




 Parent “top-level” page Format options




Auto-paging
Some MPD pages will be displayed automatically when certain events occur; this is called “auto-paging”.
Autopaging by the DMS system is automatic and contextual based on specific aircraft conditions.
DMS autopaging occurs when a critical aircraft emergency or malfunction occurs that could result in death to the
aircrew and/or catastrophic loss of the aircraft, or when an engine start sequence is initiated by the Pilot. DMS
autopaging can be suppressed in the CPG crewstation from the DMS Utility page.
 • The ENG page will be displayed in Emergency format when a new Warning message is displayed.
 • The ENG page will be displayed in Emergency format when the EMERG HYD button on the Emergency
 panel in either crewstation is pressed.
 • The ENG page will be displayed in Ground format when an ENG START switch is engaged on the Pilot’s
 Power Quadrant panel.
ASE autopaging occurs when a threat is detected that exceeds the ASE Autopage threshold set within the
crewstation on the TSD Utility or ASE pages. (See Aircraft Survivability Equipment for more information.)
 • The TSD page will be displayed when the RLWR or RFI detects radar or laser energy exceeding the
 ASE Autopage threshold. If the ASE page is displayed on either MPD, ASE autopaging is suppressed.
FCR autopaging occurs when the FCR is selected as that crewstation’s sight.
 • The FCR page will be displayed when the selected sight is changed from HMD or TADS to FCR. If the
 FCR page is displayed on the CPG’s TDU, FCR autopaging is suppressed in the CPG crewstation.

MPD Cursor
Each crewstation may utilize an MPD cursor for accessing MPD commands or interacting with MPD
displayed data and symbols. The Cursor Controller on the Collective Mission Grips and TEDAC Left
Handgrip is used to slew the cursor on the active MPD. The cursor provides the crewmembers a
means to select VAB commands on the MPD without removing their hands from the flight controls
or the TEDAC handgrips and pressing the physical button itself. When placed over a VAB label, the
label text will be bolded to indicate Cursor-Enter can be pressed.
The cursor can be moved to the opposite MPD using the Cursor Display Select button on the
Collective Mission Grip or TEDAC Left Handgrip or by “bumping” the cursor between MPDs. To
bump the cursor to the opposite display, move the cursor to the inboard edge of the MPD, release input on the
Cursor Controller, and then re-apply pressure input toward the opposite MPD. The cursor may also be utilized on
the TDU in the CPG crewstation if the FCR page is displayed on the TDU. However, the cursor can only be moved
to the TDU FCR display using the “bump” method.
The MPD cursor may be displayed in several formats, depending on the function that the cursor is performing.

MPD Symbology Colors
All MPD pages share a 6-color template for consistent indication of various types of symbology. These colors
increase the efficiency of a crewmember’s interpretation and prioritization of displayed data within the cockpit.
 • Green. Default symbology color, normal conditions, and Advisory messages.
 • Yellow. Hazards to flight, intermediate or transient operating conditions, and Caution messages
 • Red. Targets, enemy threats, conditions exceeding allowable parameters, and Warning messages.
 • White. Items requiring a crewmember’s attention, or invalid selection/data.
 • Blue. Ownship, friendly units, pitch attitudes above the horizon (sky).
 • Brown. Pitch attitudes below the horizon (ground).

In addition to colors, the intensity of the symbology itself may also be adjusted to indicate relevance or recency
of the information.
 • Full-intensity color. Relevant or current data.
 • Partial-intensity color. Less relevant or stale data.

Engine (ENG) Page
The ENG page displays engine and powertrain data and is displayed in either Ground, Flight, or Emergency
formats, based on aircraft status. ENG page data may be displayed as digital numerical values and/or analog
vertical tapes.
 • Values displayed in green represent normal operating parameters.
 • Values displayed in yellow represent intermediate or transient operating parameters that will result in
 component damage or fatigue if maintained continuously.
 • Values displayed in red represent maximum operating parameters that have been exceeded that has
 most likely resulted in component damage or fatigue and may result in imminent failure.
For data that is also displayed as an analog tape, the entire vertical tape is color-coded to indicate operating
condition, and the width of the tape will widen when outside of normal operating parameters. The increase in
the width of the tape allows crewmembers to recognize when indications are outside normal operating parameters
when the MPD is set to MONO (monochromatic) mode.


ENG Ground Format
During initial start-up of the APU, the ENG page will be displayed in Ground format, with engine oil and hydraulic
pressure windows displayed in the lower half of the page. The ENG page will return to Ground format any time
the ENG START switches are moved to the START or IGN ORIDE positions on the Pilot’s Power Quadrant panel.

 that point as the acquisition source.
 Acquisition selection may be a Waypoint, Hazard, Control Measure, pre-planned or stored Target/Threat, an
 FCR detected target. If a map location on the TSD is selected instead of a point, a Terrain point (TRN PT)
 is created at that location. If a Terrain point is designated, the location is stored as Target/Threat points
 T55 (PLT) or T56 (CPG) in the COORD file (see TSD Coordinates sub-page). A white cross labeled “PLT” or
 “CPG” will appear on the map.
17. Acquisition Source (ACQ). Displays the acquisition source selection menu. (See Acquisition Sources in
 the Tactical Employment chapter for more information.)

22. TSD Phase. Sets the TSD Phase to Navigation (NAV) or Attack (ATK). The TSD will display different
 elements of information relevant to the corresponding phase of the mission. Many of these elements may
 be configured within each crewstation based on crewmember preferences or mission requirements. (See
 TSD Show sub-page and TSD Coordinates Show sub-pages for more information.)
 • NAV. The Navigation phase is used for flights to and from the combat area. As such, its default Show
 settings are configured with a focus on navigation, routing, and avoidance of obstacles. However, most
 Show settings can be enabled/disabled similar to the Attack phase, with a few exceptions:
 o Waypoint symbols and the current Route cannot be hidden.
 o Low-priority FCR target symbols cannot be seen.
 o SHOT symbols cannot be seen.
 • ATK. The Attack phase is used for operations within the combat area or in the vicinity of the objective.
 As such, its default Show settings are configured with a focus on pre-planned targets and threats, FCR
 targeting data, and avoidance of obstacles. However, most Show settings can be enabled/disabled
 similar to the Navigation phase, with a few exceptions:
 o Waypoint Status window cannot be seen.
 o Only waypoints that are part of the current Route can be seen if CURRENT ROUTE is enabled. In
 addition, waypoints set as the crewmember’s acquisition source can also be seen.
 o Low-priority FCR target symbols can be seen, if enabled.
 o SHOT symbols can be seen.
23. TADS Footprint. Displays a top-down representation of the TADS line-of-
 sight and range when the CPG’s selected sight is set to TADS. The distance
 between the Ownship and the crosshairs represent the CPG’s current range
 value and may not directly represent the true range to the location seen
 through the TADS line-of-sight itself.
 When the TADS Laser Rangefinder/Designator (LRFD) is firing, the solid
 green line projected between the Ownship and the TADS Footprint will be
 displayed in white.
24. Center Mode (CTR). When enabled, sets the TSD to Center mode, in
 TADS Footprint
 which the TSD is centered on the Ownship. When disabled, the TSD is
 focused forward of the Ownship in a depressed mode.

26. BAM sub-page. Displays the TSD Battle Area Management sub-page.
27. MAP sub-page. Displays the TSD Map sub-page.
28. RTE sub-page. Displays the TSD Route sub-page.
TSD Pan (PAN) Sub-page
The PAN sub-page allows the crewmember to move and rotate the map independently of the Ownship location
and orientation. When using the PAN sub-page, the TSD is automatically set to Freeze mode, indicated by a
dashed border displayed around the “TSD footprint”.
The PAN sub-page not only allows the aircrew to view areas of the battlespace from a different perspective, it
also allows them to more effectively plan, modify, or preview different aspects of the mission from within the
aircraft itself, which may become necessary due to changes on the battlefield. As such, the PAN sub-page is a
critical extension of other TSD functions on the Point (POINT), Route (RTE), or Battle Area Management (BAM)
sub-pages.

1. TSD Heading. Adjusts the heading of the TSD footprint independently of the aircraft heading. Pressing the
 left arrow (VAB T4) or right arrow (VAB T6) rotates the map in 1° increments for each momentary press, or
 40° each second when pressed and held. Alternatively, HDG> (VAB T5) can be used to activate the KU for
 directly inputting the desired TSD heading.
2. Pan to Point. Activates the KU for inputting a point within the navigational database. After entry, the TSD
 will pan to the location of the point so that it is centered within the TSD footprint.
3. Pan to next Route Point. The Ghostship will pan to the corresponding point along the currently selected
 route and will orient toward the required heading on course to the subsequent route point. This can be used
 to preview the current route as if it were being flown in a sequential order as planned.
4. Route Pan. The Ghostship will pan along the route. Pressing the up arrow (VAB L3) or down arrow (VAB
 L4) will advance the Ghostship along the route a distance equal to one TSD grid square. When the up or
 down arrows are pressed and held, the TSD footprint will smoothly pan along the route in a continuous
 motion.
5. Pan to previous Route Point. The TSD footprint will pan to the corresponding point along the currently
 selected route and will orient toward the required heading on course to the subsequent route point. This
 can be used to preview the current route as if it were being flown in a reversed sequential order as planned.
 Panning to each subsequent Route Point (Left) and continuously in reverse (Right)

6. Pan Mode. Sets the PAN mode to either CURSR (default mode) or NORM mode.
 • CURSR. The TSD footprint may be moved in any direction using the Cursor Controller on the Collective
 Mission Grip or the TEDAC Left Handgrip in the CPG crewstation. Pressing Cursor-Enter will switch the
 mode to NORM.
 • NORM. The TSD footprint is re-centered on the MPD cursor location each time Cursor-Enter is pressed
 on the Collective Mission Grip or the TEDAC Left Handgrip, or the Alternate Cursor Enter Trigger is
 pulled on the Collective Mission Grip or the Alternate Cursor Enter button is pressed on the TEDAC
 Right Handgrip.
7. Pan Cursor. When the MPD cursor is assigned to an MPD that is displaying the TSD PAN sub-page while
 the PAN mode is set to CURSR, the cursor is placed in the bottom left corner of the MPD. The TSD footprint
 is slaved to the MPD cursor and will move with it until PAN mode is toggled to NORM, PAN sub-page is
 exited, or the MPD cursor is re-assigned to the opposite MPD using the Cursor Display Select button on the
 Collective Mission Grip or the TEDAC Left Handgrip.
8. Freeze Footprint. Indicates the TSD is in Freeze mode. All TSD symbology and navigation data will
 continue to update as normal, but the focal point of the TSD footprint will be the white Ghostship symbol.
 The blue Ownship symbol will continue to move across the map independently of the TSD footprint to display
 the actual aircraft position.
9. Ghostship. Indicates the focal point of the TSD footprint any time the TSD is in Freeze mode.
10. Last Pan. Resets the TSD to the previous location and heading prior to the most
 recent Pan action.
11. Altitude Control. Enables/disables the Ghostship altitude controls. This option is
 only displayed when COLOR BAND is set to A/C or ELEV on the MAP sub-page.
12. Altitude Controls. Adjusts the Ghostship’s altitude above ground level (AGL)
 independently of the Ownship. Pressing the up arrow (VAB R3) or down arrow
 (VAB R5) adjusts the altitude in 10 foot increments for each momentary press, or
 10 feet each second when pressed and held. Alternatively, ATL> (VAB R4) can be
 used to activate the KU for directly inputting the desired Ghostship altitude.

FLIGHT MANAGEMENT COMPUTER (FMC)
The AH-64D incorporates a Flight Management Computer (FMC) that can electronically command movement to
the flight control servo-actuators for reduced pilot workload and accurate weapons delivery. The FMC also
provides stabilator scheduling based on collective position and longitudinal calibrated airspeed; and Back-Up
Control System (BUCS) functionality in case of jams or severances within the cockpit flight controls.




The FMC’s three primary functions regarding aircraft control are Stability
Augmentation, Command Augmentation, and Hold mode functionality. The Stability
and Command Augmentation Systems (collectively referred to as “SCAS”) are always
active within the FMC channels, however each FMC channel may be individually
enabled/disabled via the Aircraft Utility (UTIL) page. Alternatively, all FMC channels
may be disabled immediately using the FMC Release “pinkie” button on the Cyclic Grip
in either crewstation.
The cyclic, collective, and pedals in each cockpit utilize a collection of sensors called
Linear Variable Differential Transducers (LVDT) to measure the position and
movement of each flight control axis and relay these movements to the FMC. These
movements are used by the FMC to process SCAS commands to the flight controls
during normal operations, or to provide full “fly-by-wire” flight control functions during
an emergency when in BUCS mode. FMC Release Button

Each FMC channel corresponds to an individual hydromechanical servo-actuator that manipulates the main or tail
rotor swashplate assemblies; and each of these servo-actuators includes an electronically commanded hydraulic
valve. This valve can be commanded by the FMC to initiate movement of the servo-actuator control linkage to
the swashplate independently of, or in conjunction with, direct mechanical inputs from the flight controls within
the crewstations. The component within each servo-actuator that initiates these control movements is referred
to as the “SAS sleeve”, and each possesses a limited range of motion to provide SCAS and hold mode functionality
(±10% authority in all axes except the pitch axis, which is +20% forward and -10% aft authority).
The FMC commands the flight control servo-actuators based on the following:
 • Flight control inputs as reported through the Linear Variable Differential Transducers (LVDT)
 • Aircraft rate information from the EGI’s
 • Helicopter Air Data System (HADS)
 • Radar altimeter
 • Pitot and static port pressure sensors
The FMC can only command movement to the servo-actuators via the SAS sleeves through the Primary hydraulic
system. Therefore, if the Primary hydraulic system fails or loses pressure, the aircraft can still be flown using the
Utility hydraulic system, but without the stability and augmentation the FMC provides; nor will hold modes or
BUCS be available.
When flying from the cockpit, the Controls Indicator may be displayed by pressing [RCtrl]+[Enter] to view a
visual representation of the flight control positions and their behavior, as commanded by the FMC. (See the DCS
Fundamentals chapter for more information.)


Stability Augmentation System
The Stability Augmentation System (SAS) function of the FMC provides a stable aircraft for reduced pilot workload
and increased weapons delivery accuracy. SAS is active in each FMC control axis that is enabled via the Utility
(UTIL) page any time the force trim release on the Cyclic Grip is not pressed. SAS inputs are limited by the
authority of the SAS sleeves within each flight control servo-actuator (±10% authority in all axes except the pitch
axis, which is +20% forward and -10% aft authority).
When necessary, the FMC commands movement of the SAS sleeves within the applicable flight control servo-
actuator(s) to provide the following:
 • Yaw rate damping <40 knots ground speed. When accelerating, yaw rate damping will be present until
 ground speed is ≥40 knots. When decelerating from ground speeds ≥40 knots, yaw rate damping
 won’t return until ground speed is <30 knots.
 • Turn coordination ≥40 knots ground speed. When decelerating from ground speeds ≥40 knots, turn
 coordination will be present until ground speed is <30 knots. When accelerating, turn coordination
 won’t return until ground speed is ≥40 knots.
 • Lateral (roll) and Longitudinal (pitch) rate damping at all speeds.
 • Atmospheric upset damping.
Rate damping minimizes attitude oscillations within the respective pitch, roll and yaw axes, but will not prevent
attitude drift from the force trimmed positions of the flight controls. Atmospheric upset damping reduces the
effect of atmospheric disturbances (such as turbulence) from affecting the aircraft's flight path.
The EGI inertial measurements provide airframe movements/rates to the FMC, which compares the EGI data to
the flight control LVDTs. If there are no changes in the flight control positions, the FMC commands the respective
servo-actuator SAS sleeves to counter the un-commanded movements.
Command Augmentation System
The Command Augmentation System (CAS) function of the FMC provides an immediate and uniform aircraft
response at all longitudinal airspeeds. CAS is active in each FMC control axis that is enabled via the Utility (UTIL)
page. CAS input limitations are the same as SAS (±10% authority in all axes except the pitch axis, which is +20%
forward and -10% aft authority).
When a control input is made, the FMC detects the flight control movement in the respective LVDT axis (or axes)
and will command movement of the SAS sleeve within the applicable flight control servo-actuator(s). This provides
a “power steering” response to remove the lag effect of mechanical inputs into the flight control servo-actuators.
At lower longitudinal airspeeds, the amount of CAS input is proportionally increased to ensure the aircraft handling
remains consistent with flight at higher airspeeds.

 Low Airspeed




 Additional input from CAS Pitch rate




 Command Augmentation at different airspeeds

CAS is disabled in the FMC Yaw channel when the aircraft is on the ground (determined by the weight-on-wheels
or “squat” switch). This prevents over-steering during ground taxi.
Force Trim & “Breakout” Values
The Cyclic Grip includes the Force Trim/Hold Mode switch. When this R Force Trim Release
4-way switch is pressed to the forward R (Release) position, the force
trim magnetic brakes on the cyclic and pedals are released. This
 AL Altitude Hold
position is analogous to pressing the “force trim interrupt” button in AT Attitude Hold
other helicopters. The force trim release in the AH-64D serves three
purposes in flight:
 D Disengage Hold Modes
 • Disengages the magnetic brakes of the force trim system
 on the cyclic and pedals.
 • Temporarily disengages any active hold modes that are
 currently engaged in the pitch, roll, and yaw axes and
 (while pressed) allows the SAS sleeves to re-center within
 the respective servo-actuators.
 • Sets new reference values of pitch, roll, heading, sideslip,
 velocity, or position; depending on what Attitude Hold
 modes/sub-modes are active at any given time. Force Trim/Hold Mode Switch

When the Force Trim/Hold Mode switch is pressed to the left AT position, Attitude Hold is enabled, and will enter
one of three sub-modes based on current ground speed (see Attitude Hold for more information). A subsequent
press to the left AT position will disable the Attitude Hold.
When the Force Trim/Hold Mode switch is pressed to the right AL position, Altitude Hold is enabled (if within
vertical speed parameters), and will enter one of two sub-modes based on current ground speed and altitude
above ground level (see Altitude Hold for more information). A subsequent press to the right AL position will
disable the Altitude Hold.
When the Force Trim/Hold Mode switch is pressed to the aft D position, Attitude Hold and Altitude Hold modes
will be disabled.
Any time the force trim release is pressed, Attitude Hold (if enabled) and Heading Hold (always enabled) will be
temporarily disengaged. When the force trim release is no longer pressed, these hold modes will attempt to re-
engage and “capture” new reference values to hold, based on the sub-mode within which they are operating.
Even if the force trim release is not pressed, a “breakout” value within each flight control axis of the cyclic and
pedals allows the pilot to “fly through” the hold modes. These breakout values do not disable the hold modes
altogether but will temporarily disengage their function, and the SAS sleeves in the corresponding flight control
servo-actuators will no longer hold the commanded reference value(s) until the conditions for hold mode re-
engagement are met.


Hold Modes
The hold modes are designed to provide limited hands-off flight and decrease pilot workload. Like the SAS and
CAS functions of the FMC, the hold modes utilize the same SAS sleeves within the servo-actuators to affect the
aircraft flight controls. As such, they are subject to the same limited control authorities (±10% in roll, yaw and
collective; +20% and -10% in pitch) and are not autopilot functions.
To best utilize the FMC hold mode functionality, the pilot should first fly the aircraft to a stable, force-trimmed
state. Once the aircraft is set at the desired flight condition, engage the desired hold mode(s).
Although there are only two Hold mode selections that can be made by the pilot (enabling/disabling the Attitude
Hold or the Altitude Hold), the Hold modes themselves include multiple sub-modes within each flight control axis
that are contextually selected by the FMC based on the specific flight conditions within which the aircraft is being
operated. As a whole, this can be considered a “task”-based approach to sub-mode selection, in which the FMC
selects the best sub-modes in the applicable flight control axes to achieve the level of flight control assistance
requested by the pilot. This is distinct from manual selection of hold sub-modes, which would require additional
interaction by the pilot to manage the hold modes themselves as flight conditions changed, counter to the original
purpose of reducing pilot workload.
Each sub-mode within the corresponding flight control axis is mutually exclusive, meaning that only one sub-
mode can be active within a flight control axis at any given time. The applicable hold sub-modes within each FMC
axis are shown below.
Attitude (AT) Hold sub-modes Heading Hold sub-modes Altitude Hold (AL) sub-modes
Pitch and Roll axes. Yaw axis only. Collective axis only.
• Attitude Hold • Heading Hold • Barometric Altitude Hold
• Velocity Hold • Turn Coordination • Radar Altitude Hold
• Position Hold (SAS function)
Heading Hold is distinct in that it is always active and cannot be enabled/disabled independently of the yaw axis
itself. In addition, Turn Coordination, although it is a SAS function and not a hold sub-mode, is always enabled
along with Heading Hold, and will be referenced in the following sections. However, like the sub-modes in the
other axes, Heading Hold and Turn Coordination are mutually exclusive and are automatically selected by the
FMC based on flight conditions.
With regard to sub-mode selection, the pilot should not adjust the flight conditions to force the FMC to utilize one
hold mode over the other. Rather, the pilot should understand the unique flight control requirements that exist
under various flight conditions which lead to the FMC’s logic in selecting the most appropriate sub-mode that
should be utilized at any given time. The pilot only needs to enable hold mode assistance using the Force
Trim/Hold Mode switch, and the appropriate hold sub-mode will assist the pilot in performing the current task,
provided the force trim is not being depressed and the flight controls are within their respective breakout values.
As an example of this concept, the Attitude Hold will enter one of its three sub-modes based on the ground speed
of the aircraft.
• If the aircraft is ≤5 knots ground speed, the FMC will select Position Hold. The FMC will attempt to hold a
 hover over a fixed position on the ground since such a flight condition would most likely only exist if the
 pilot was attempting to do so.
• If the aircraft is >5 knots but <40 knots ground speed, the FMC will select Velocity Hold sub-mode. In this
 instance, the FMC will attempt to maintain the current velocity and direction across the surface since such
 a flight condition would most likely only exist if the pilot was attempting to perform low-speed flight at a
 constant speed and direction (possibly even sideways or backwards) between battle positions or when
 maneuvering near obstacles at low altitude.
 As a helicopter’s attitude directly affects its velocity and direction, maintaining a constant attitude will result
 in a constant velocity and direction; however, when operating at speeds below 40 knots the main rotor wash
 and flight direction may produce different airflow effects across different portions of the airframe, which
 may be exacerbated by local surface winds. As a result of these influences and flight maneuver requirements,
 the FMC uses the velocity and direction as its reference instead of simply the pitch/bank attitude.
• If the aircraft is ≥40 knots ground speed, the FMC will select Attitude Hold sub-mode. When performing
 flight above 40 knots, the pilot is most likely performing forward “cruise” flight since sideways flight with
 excessive sideslip at such speeds would be quite hazardous for safe aircraft operation. As such, the FMC will
 attempt to maintain the pitch and roll attitudes to maintain the cruise flight condition.
 If in a turn, the FMC will maintain the current bank angle to continue the turn. If the bank angle is <3°, the
 FMC assumes the pilot intends to maintain level flight and will auto-level the aircraft to 0° bank angle. The
 pitch angle will also be maintained by the FMC, which in turn will maintain the aircraft velocity since a
 helicopter’s pitch attitude directly affects its velocity in forward flight, but is not subject to the same airflow
 disturbances when compared to low speeds.
When Attitude Hold is enabled, a box will be placed around the airspeed indicator in the HDU Flight symbology
and on the FLT page; and the “ATTITUDE HOLD” advisory will be displayed on the EUFD.




 Attitude Hold Indicator Altitude Hold Indicator




When Altitude Hold is enabled, a “home plate” box will be placed around the VSI indicator in the HDU Flight
symbology and on the FLT page; and either the “RAD ALT HOLD” or the “BAR ALT HOLD” advisory will be
displayed on the EUFD, depending on what Altitude Hold sub-mode is entered.




 Hold Mode Advisories




Any time the Attitude Hold or Altitude Hold are disabled using the Force Trim/Hold Mode switch, the hold mode
indicators within the HMD symbology and on the FLT page will flash and an audio tone will alert the crew that a
hold mode has been deactivated.
Heading Hold & Turn Coordination Sub-modes
The FMC Yaw channel operates within two SAS sub-modes: Yaw Damping and Turn Coordination. Either of these
sub-modes are enabled any time FMC Yaw channel is turned on, depending on the measured ground speed of
the aircraft. In addition, the FMC Yaw channel may also operate in a Heading Hold mode. None of these modes
may be disabled; however, condition-based logic will determine within which sub-mode the Yaw channel is
operating, and whether that sub-mode is engaged or disengaged from affecting the flight control servo-actuators
at any given time.
The primary condition that determines which sub-mode is enabled is the helicopter’s ground speed, and in
addition whether Attitude Hold is enabled. If the ground speed is <40 knots, Heading Hold or Yaw Damping sub-
mode is enabled. If the ground speed is ≥40 knots, Turn Coordination is enabled. If the ground speed is ≥40
knots and Attitude Hold is enabled, the sub-mode may switch between Heading Hold and Turn Coordination,
based on criteria described below.
The “breakout values” within the Yaw channel become incrementally larger with forward speed. The purpose
behind this is to desensitize the pedals to prevent disengaging the Heading Hold during cruise flight.
Heading Hold
Heading Hold assists the pilot in maintaining the magnetic heading reference. If the force trim release is pressed,
Heading Hold is disengaged and the FMC Yaw channel will only provide command augmentation. When the pilot
stops pressing the force trim release and the parameters for Heading Hold engagement are met, the FMC will
update the Heading Hold reference to the current magnetic heading and engage Heading Hold.
If Attitude Hold is disabled, Heading Hold will engage when all of the following conditions are true:
 • One second has elapsed since Heading Hold was disengaged
 • The helicopter is off the weight-on-wheels (“squat”) switch
 • Ground speed <40 knots
 • Pedal displacement ≤3% in yaw axis from the force trim reference position
 • Force trim is not pressed
 • Yaw rate <3° per second




 Ground Speed <40 knots


 5 knots 30 knots 40 knots




 ≤3% pedal displacement Force trim not pressed Yaw rate <3° per second

 Heading Hold engagement (Attitude Hold disabled)
If Attitude Hold is enabled in Position or Velocity sub-modes, Heading Hold will engage when all of the
following conditions are true:
 • Pedal displacement ≤3% in yaw axis from the force trim reference position in Position Hold sub-mode
 or ≤6% in yaw axis from the force trim reference position in Velocity Hold sub-mode
 • Force trim is not pressed
 • Yaw rate <3° per second

 from force trim position

 Heading Hold engagement (Position Hold enabled)




 ≤6% pedal displacement Force trim not pressed Yaw rate <3° per second
 from force trim position

 Heading Hold engagement (Velocity Hold enabled)

Heading Hold will engage under certain conditions if Attitude Hold is enabled and in Attitude Hold sub-mode, but
this logic is inter-woven along with Turn Coordination and is described below.
Turn Coordination Sub-mode
Turn Coordination sub-mode assists the pilot in maintaining the sideslip angle, and is a function of roll attitude,
airspeed, and sideslip. Sideslip angle is a derived quantity based on inertial velocity as opposed to air data. This
method of determining sideslip angle provides more stable and reliable sideslip information than can be obtained
from an air data sensor. If the force trim release switch is pressed, Turn Coordination is disengaged, and the
FMC Yaw channel will only provide command augmentation and rate damping. When the pilot stops pressing the
force trim release switch, the FMC will update the Turn Coordination sideslip angle reference to the current trim
ball position.
If Attitude Hold is disabled, Turn Coordination will engage when all of the following conditions are true:
 • Ground speed ≥40 knots
 • Pedal displacement ≤9% in yaw axis from the force trim reference position
 • Force trim is not pressed




 Ground Speed >40 knots


 5 knots 30 knots 40 knots




 ≤9% pedal displacement from Force trim not pressed
 force trim position

 Turn Coordination engagement (Attitude Hold disabled)

If Attitude Hold is enabled with ground speed ≥40 knots, Turn Coordination will switch to Heading Hold when
all of the following conditions are true:
 • Pedal displacement ≤9% in yaw axis from the force trim reference position
 • Cyclic displacement ≤2.25% in roll axis from the force trim position
 • Roll (bank) angle is ≤3° from level attitude
 • Force trim is not pressed




 ≤9% pedal displacement from ≤2.25% roll from Force trim not pressed Roll angle ≤3° from level
 force trim position force trim position

 Turn Coordination switches to Heading Hold (Attitude Hold enabled)
If Attitude Hold is enabled with ground speed ≥40 knots, Heading Hold will revert to Turn Coordination if any
of the following conditions are true:
 • Pedal displacement >9% in yaw axis from the force trim reference position
 • Cyclic displacement >2.25% in roll axis from the force trim position
 • Roll (bank) angle is >7° from level attitude
 • Force Trim is pressed




 or or or


 >9% pedal displacement from >2.25% roll from Force trim pressed Roll angle >7° from level
 force trim position force trim position

 Heading Hold reverts to Turn Coordination (Attitude Hold enabled)



Attitude Hold & Position/Velocity Hold Sub-modes
The FMC Pitch and Roll channels operate with Attitude Hold and two additional sub-modes: Position Hold and
Velocity Hold. Only one of these three sub-modes can be activated at any given time, only when the Attitude
Hold is activated using the Force Trim/Hold Mode switch when pressed to the Left/AT position, and only when
the FMC Pitch and Roll channels are turned on. Condition-based logic will determine which sub-mode the
Pitch/Roll channels are using, and whether that sub-mode is engaged or disengaged from affecting the flight
control servo-actuators at any given time.
The condition that determines which Attitude Hold sub-mode the Pitch/Roll channels operate within is the
helicopter’s ground speed. If the ground speed is ≤5 knots, Position Hold sub-mode is activated. If the ground
speed is >5 knots but <40 knots, Velocity Hold sub-mode is activated. If ground speed is ≥40 knots, Attitude
Hold sub-mode will be activated.




 Position Hold
 Velocity Hold Attitude Hold
 5 knots 30 knots 40 knots
 Attitude Hold enabled Ground Speed

 Attitude Hold Sub-modes

Attitude Hold may be activated while still on the ground, however it will not engage in any sub-mode until the
helicopter is off the weight-on-wheels (“squat”) switch.
Position Hold Sub-mode
When Position Hold sub-mode is engaged, the FMC will use velocities provided by the EGI to approximate and
maintain its position. If the pilot presses the force trim, or displaces the cyclic beyond the breakout values in
pitch or roll (2.5% in the pitch axis or 2.25% in the roll axis) without pressing the force trim, Position Hold will
disengage and the SAS will revert to rate damping only. Once the cyclic is returned within the breakout values
and the force trim is no longer pressed, the aircraft’s current position will be captured as the new reference
position, Position Hold will re-engage, and the FMC will command SAS sleeve inputs into the Pitch and Roll servo-
actuators to maintain the aircraft over the reference position.
To re-position the helicopter and set a new position reference, the pilot should press and hold the force trim
release switch, translate the helicopter to the desired location, and then stop pressing the force trim release
switch when a stable hover has been established. Pressing the force trim release switch is not necessary if the
cyclic position exceeds the breakout values, however pressing and holding the force trim will allow the SAS
sleeves to center themselves within their respective axes, ensuring maximum authority in each direction when
Position Hold is re-engaged. If the pilot accelerates the aircraft above 5 knots ground speed and then returns the
cyclic within the breakout values and stops pressing the force trim, Velocity Hold sub-mode will be entered.
Since Position Hold is only engaged when ground speed is ≤5 knots while the force trim release switch is not
pressed, Heading Hold will also be active in the FMC Yaw axis while operating in this sub-mode. However, if the
pedals are displaced ≥3% from the force trim reference position, Heading Hold will disengage and will only re-
engage given the conditions listed in the Heading Hold & Turn Coordination Sub-modes description.
Velocity Hold Sub-mode
When Velocity Hold sub-mode is engaged, the FMC will use inertial velocities provided by the EGI to maintain a
2-dimensional velocity and in the horizontal plane. If the pilot presses the force trim, or displaces the cyclic
beyond the breakout values in pitch or roll (2.5% in the pitch axis or 2.25% in the roll axis) without pressing the
force trim, Velocity Hold will disengage and the SAS will revert to rate damping only. Once the cyclic is returned
within the breakout values and the force trim is no longer pressed, the aircraft’s current velocity and vector will
be captured as the new reference velocity, Velocity Hold will re-engage, and the FMC will command SAS sleeve
inputs into the Pitch and Roll servo-actuators to maintain the current velocity and relative direction over the
ground.
To establish a new velocity and/or vector reference, the pilot should press and hold the force trim release switch,
adjust the flight controls to attain the desired velocity and vector, and then stop pressing the force trim release
switch when a stable flight condition has been established. Pressing the force trim release switch is not necessary
if the cyclic position exceeds the breakout values, however pressing and holding the force trim will allow the SAS
sleeves to center themselves within their respective axes, ensuring maximum authority in each direction when
Velocity Hold is re-engaged. If the pilot accelerates the aircraft to 40 knots ground speed or greater and then
returns the cyclic within the breakout values and stops pressing the force trim, Attitude Hold sub-mode will be
entered. If the pilot decelerates the aircraft to 5 knots ground speed or less and then returns the cyclic within
the breakout values and stops pressing the force trim, Position Hold sub-mode will be entered.
Since Velocity Hold is only engaged when ground speed is >5 knots and <40 knots while the force trim release
switch is not pressed, Heading Hold will also be active in the FMC Yaw axis while operating in this sub-mode.
However, if pedals are displaced ≥6% from the force trim reference position, Heading Hold will disengage and
will only re-engage given the conditions listed in the Heading Hold & Turn Coordination Sub-modes description.
Attitude Hold
When Attitude Hold sub-mode is engaged, the FMC will use rates and attitudes provided by the EGI to maintain
a pitch and roll attitude. If the pilot presses the force trim, or displaces the cyclic beyond the breakout values in
pitch or roll (2.5% in the pitch axis or 2.25% in the roll axis) without pressing the force trim, Attitude Hold will
disengage and the SAS will revert to rate damping only. However, unlike Position or Velocity Hold submodes,
Attitude Hold will only disengage in the respective axis in which a breakout value has been exceeded.
As an example, if the pilot displaces the cyclic >2.25% in the Roll axis only, the FMC will disengage Attitude Hold
in the Roll servo-actuator only, but still provide SAS rate damping functions for that actuator. The FMC will
continue to maintain the referenced pitch attitude by commanding movement to the SAS sleeve within the Pitch
servo-actuator. Once the cyclic is returned within the breakout values, the aircraft’s current pitch and/or roll
attitude will be captured as the new reference attitude, Attitude Hold will re-engage in the respective axis, and
the FMC will command SAS sleeve inputs into the Pitch and Roll servo-actuators to maintain the current pitch and
roll attitude. However, if the roll reference is <3° from a level roll attitude, the bank angle will be commanded to
0° and the aircraft will auto-level.
This axis-specific breakout logic allows a pilot to adjust the airspeed or bank angle without disengaging the other
axis being commanded by the FMC in Attitude Hold sub-mode, or by pressing the force trim. This can be
convenient for flying an orbit or navigating a route at cruise speeds.
To establish a new attitude reference, the pilot should press and hold the force trim release switch, adjust the
flight controls to attain the desired attitude, and then stop pressing the force trim release switch when a stable
flight condition has been established. Pressing the force trim release switch is not necessary if the cyclic position
exceeds the breakout values, however pressing and holding the force trim will allow the SAS sleeves to center
themselves within their respective axes, ensuring maximum authority in each direction when Attitude Hold is re-
engaged.
If the ground speed decreases below 40 knots but remains above 30 knots, and the pilot does not displace the
cyclic beyond its breakout values nor press the force trim, Attitude Hold will be maintained and will not enter
Velocity Hold sub-mode.




 Ground Speed ≥40 knots

 Velocity Hold Attitude Hold
 Force trim not pressed 5 knots 30 knots 40 knots


 Attitude Hold Sub-mode maintained if force trim is not pressed

However, if the pilot displaces the cyclic beyond its breakout values and then returns the cyclic within the breakout
values while still below 40 knots ground speed, Velocity Hold sub-mode will be entered. Likewise, if the ground
speed decreases below 40 knots but above 30 knots and the pilot presses the force trim prior to accelerating
back to 40 knots ground speed or greater, Velocity Hold will be entered.




 Ground Speed ≥40 knots

 Velocity Hold Attitude Hold
 Force trim pressed/released 5 knots 30 knots 40 knots


 Velocity Hold Sub-mode entered if force trim is pressed <40 knots
If the ground speed decreases below 30 knots ground speed, Velocity Hold will be entered regardless of
whether the pilot has displaced the cyclic beyond its breakout values or pressed the force trim.




 Ground Speed ≥40 knots

 Velocity Hold Attitude Hold
 Force trim not pressed 5 knots 30 knots 40 knots

Heading Hold or Turn Coordination will also be active in the FMC Yaw axis while operating in Attitude Hold sub-
mode, subject to the logic described in the Heading Hold & Turn Coordination Sub-modes description.
Attitude Hold will engage when all the following conditions are true:
 • The helicopter is off the weight-on-wheels (“squat”) switch
 • Cyclic displacement ≤2.25% in roll and ≤2.5% in pitch from the force trim reference position
 • Roll attitude <±60° and Pitch attitude <±30°
 • Pitch and Roll rates <5° per second (Attitude Hold sub-mode only)
 • Force trim is not pressed

 Attitude Hold Engagement
Altitude Hold Modes
The FMC Collective channel operates within two hold sub-modes: Radar Altitude Hold and
Barometric Altitude Hold. Only one of these sub-modes can be engaged at any given time,
and only when the Altitude Hold is activated using the Force Trim/Hold Mode switch when
pressed to the Right/AL position, and only when the FMC Collective channel is turned on.
Condition-based logic will determine which sub-mode the Collective channel is using, and
whether that sub-mode is engaged or disengaged from affecting the flight control servo-
actuators at any given time.
The conditions that primarily determine which Altitude Hold sub-mode the Collective channel Altitude Hold enabled
operates within is the helicopter’s ground speed and the radar altimeter. If the ground speed
is <40 knots and the radar altitude is ≤1,428 feet AGL, Radar Altitude Hold sub-mode will be activated. If the
ground speed is ≥ 40 knots or the radar altitude is >1,428 feet AGL, Barometric Altitude Hold sub-mode is
activated. Additional logic governing the activation or de-activation of these sub-modes are listed below.
Radar Altitude Hold Sub-Mode
Radar Altitude Hold is not a terrain following mode. It provides distance from the ground directly below the
aircraft and does not provide any approaching terrain variation information.
Radar Altitude Hold may only be engaged when all of the following conditions are true:
 • Ground speed <40 knots
 • Altitude is ≤1,428 feet above ground level (AGL)
 • Vertical velocity is ≤100 feet per minute
 • The radar altimeter is powered on and operational

 • Either engine torque (TQ) >100%
 • Either engine Turbine Gas Temperature (TGT) >867° C

Barometric Altitude Hold Sub-Mode
Barometric Altitude Hold can only be activated when both of the following conditions are true:
 • If conditions for Radar Altitude Hold sub-mode activation cannot be met
 • Vertical velocity is within the limits below as determined by aircraft ground speed:
 o If ground speed is <40 knots, vertical velocity is ≤200 feet per minute
 o From 40 to 160 knots ground speed, the vertical velocity rate limit increases linearly from
 ±200 feet per minute at 40 knots to ±400 feet per minute at 160 knots. (Example: at 100
 knots ground speed, the vertical velocity rate limit must be ≤300 feet per minute)

Flight Control Advisories
Since the SAS sleeve within each servo-actuator possesses a limited authority to affect the flight controls (±10%
authority in all axes except the pitch axis, which is +20% forward and -10% aft authority), if a hold mode is
engaged and the SAS sleeve has reached the limit of its authority, the SAS sleeve is described as “saturated”. If
the saturation condition persists, the FMC’s ability to maintain the reference values of pitch, roll, heading, sideslip,
velocity, or position will be degraded. Any time one or more servo-actuator has become saturated, a brief Flight
Control audio tone will be heard and an advisory will be displayed on the EUFD to alert the crew.




 SAS Saturation Advisory




The Flight Control audio tone will sound with an associated EUFD advisory when the criteria listed below is met
for each respective sub-mode:
• If in Attitude Hold sub-mode, the SAS SATURATED advisory will be presented to the crew after 90 seconds
 of continuous saturation within the Pitch, Roll or Collective axes or 10 seconds of continuous saturation
 within the Yaw axis.
• If in Velocity Hold sub-mode, the SAS SATURATED advisory will be presented to the crew after 2 seconds
 of continuous saturation within the Pitch, Roll or Collective axes or 7 seconds of continuous saturation within
 the Yaw axis.
• If in Position Hold sub-mode, the SAS SATURATED advisory will be presented to the crew after 1 second of
 continuous saturation within the Pitch, Roll or Collective axes or 5 seconds of continuous saturation within
 the Yaw axis.
• If in Position Hold sub-mode, the HOVER DRIFT advisory will be presented to the crew if the aircraft drifts
 greater than 48 feet (one rotor diameter) from the reference position.
• If in Barometric Altitude Hold, the ALTITUDE DRIFT advisory will be presented to the crew if the aircraft
 drifts greater than ±100 feet from the reference altitude.
• If in Radar Altitude Hold, the ALTITUDE DRIFT advisory will be presented to the crew if the aircraft drifts
 greater than ±5 feet from the reference altitude at 10 feet, increasing to ±100 feet at 1,400 feet altitude.
When the pilot presses the force trim release (which also interrupts any hold modes that are enabled in the FMC
Pitch, Roll and/or Yaw channels), the SAS sleeves within the Pitch, Roll, and Yaw servo-actuators will return to
center within 3 to 5 seconds. While the SAS sleeve is moving to center, it will continue to provide command
augmentation to ensure an immediate and uniform flight control response.
During sideward flight or hovering flight with high crosswinds without the force trim pressed, a SAS SATURATED
advisory and Flight Control audio tone may be presented to the crew. Under these conditions, the relative wind
from sideward flight or high crosswinds will apply force to the vertical tail, creating a weathervane effect in which
the nose will turn into the wind. The FMC will attempt to compensate for this weathervane effect while in Heading
Hold sub-mode, which may result in saturation of the SAS sleeve within the Yaw servo-actuator.

AIRCRAFT START
The AH-64 was designed to be operated from a “field environment” away from established ground support
infrastructure or airfield facilities. Although it is equipped with external power and pneumatic air receptacles,
allowing it to be supported by Aviation Ground Power Units (AGPU) or other ground support equipment, the
primary method of starting the aircraft is via its integrated GTCP36-155 Auxiliary Power Unit (the same gas
turbine engine that powers the AGPU).




Once the APU is up to operating speed, the APU drive shaft mechanically engages the main transmission’s
accessory gearbox, which in turn powers the primary and utility hydraulic pumps and both AC generators. This
pressurizes the flight control servo-actuators and enables AC electrical power to be delivered to some aircraft
systems, including both Transformer Rectifier Units (TRU) which converts AC power to DC power. Once DC power
is supplied to the remainder of the electrical busses, all aircraft systems may be configured as necessary, and the
aircraft battery will be charged.


Prior to Starting APU
After an external preflight inspection and walk-around has been performed by the aircrew to ensure the aircraft
is flightworthy and all gear and equipment is properly secured within the storage bays, the aircrew enters their
respective crewstations. The seat harness restraints are secured and the crewmembers secure intercom cables
and electrical connectors that supply power to the IHU helmet-tracking sensors.
If not already performed during the preflight inspection, the aircrew inspects their crewstation to ensure all
switches and knobs are set appropriately prior to enabling electrical power and starting the APU.

3. PLT & CPG Aircraft systems – Initialize and configure remaining options as appropriate for mission.


Initialize Aircraft Systems
After a Master Load has been completed on the DTU page, remaining options within each cockpit are configured
for the mission. This process is commonly referred to as a “DMS sweep”. A DMS sweep may be conducted in
accordance with crewmember preferences, but it is important to be consistent and coordinate with the other
crewmember to ensure any settings that are common between crewstations are agreed upon and the start-up
process is conducted in an efficient manner. (© Denotes “common” options or settings)

TAXI & BEFORE TAKEOFF
The AH-64 may perform hover taxi (<25 feet and <20 knots) or air taxi (<100 feet and/or >20 knots) operations
like any other helicopter, but ground taxi is typically used when feasible. Ground taxi allows the aircraft to be re-
positioned away from other aircraft and ground support equipment using a lower power setting, which minimizes
the rotor wash effects on the aircraft surroundings. This prevents foreign object damage to other aircraft, blowing
dust/snow, and allows ground personnel to continue operations on the flight line with minimal disturbance.




The AH-64 uses a free-rotating tail wheel to facilitate taxi maneuvers on the flight line, which can be selectively
locked to the rear position by either crewmember. Steering control is provided by tail rotor thrust, controlled by
the anti-torque pedals within the cockpit. As such, it is advisable that the aircrew keep the tail wheel locked until
aircraft movement has been initiated and the aircraft is clear of personnel and equipment. This allows the
crewmember on the controls to better ascertain the appropriate pedal positions that are required to prevent the
tail from adversely swinging to either side after the tail wheel is unlocked.


Before Taxi
Prior to initiating ground taxi, perform the following:
1. PLT / CPG Chocks removed – Verify with ground personnel.
2. PLT / CPG Bleed Air – On (UTIL page).
3. PLT / CPG ANTI-ICE – As required (UTIL page).
4. PLT EXT LT panel – Verify NAV lights are set in accordance with local procedures, ANTI-COL – WHT for day
 or RED for night, FORM knob set as appropriate.
5. PLT & CPG Searchlight – As required.
6. PLT PARK BRAKE – Release by applying wheel brake pressure; ensure PARK BRAKE handle is inward.
Ground Taxi
NVS mode or the searchlight may be used to assist with ground taxi under low-light conditions, 1
 2
or a combination of both. Ground taxi is typically performed in the following manner:
1. Select Transition symbology mode (Symbology Select switch – Forward).
2. Press and hold the force trim (Force Trim/Hold Mode switch – Forward).
3. With the cyclic in the neutral position, increase the collective to 27-30%.
 NOTE: Additional collective (30-35%) may be necessary to initiate ground taxi movement
 when the aircraft is at a high gross weight and/or at a location with a high density altitude.
4. Apply forward cyclic to begin taxi movement. Use left/right pedal inputs as necessary to
 maintain heading and left/right cyclic inputs to maintain a level fuselage attitude. Ensure the aircraft is clear
 of personnel and equipment before unlocking the tail wheel. The force trim may be held throughout this
 maneuver as desired, or it may be released and pressed intermittently as necessary.
 NOTE: The Horizon Line within the HDU Flight symbology may be used as a reference for a level fuselage
 attitude. The Skid/Slip Indicator should not be used as a reference as it will not indicate a level fuselage
 attitude while the aircraft is performing a turn.
5. Prior to initiating a turn when ground taxiing, ensure the tail wheel is unlocked
 (“UNLOCK” light is illuminated on the TAIL WHEEL button). Either crewmember
 may unlock the tail wheel, but as a common practice the crewmember on the 5
 controls will command tail wheel lock/unlock using the Tail Wheel Lock/Unlock
 button on the Collective Flight Grip.
6. Apply pedal in the intended direction of the turn while applying cyclic input in the same direction to maintain
 a level fuselage attitude. Apply left/right pedal inputs using an alternating sequence of “pressure/counter-
 pressure” on the pedals to maintain a constant and controlled rate of turn.
7. Prior to stopping the ground taxi or lifting off the ground, ensure the tail wheel is locked (“UNLOCK” light is
 not illuminated on the TAIL WHEEL button). Once the tail wheel is locked, apply aft cyclic to decelerate the
 aircraft. When the aircraft has stopped, set the cyclic into the center position prior to lowering the collective.
 The wheel brakes may also be used to assist with stopping the aircraft.
 NOTE: The “TAIL WHEEL LOCK SEL” and “TAIL WHEEL UNLK SEL”
 advisories on the EUFD indicate the commanded state of the tail wheel
 locking actuator as selected by the aircrew, but do not reflect whether the
 tail wheel is physically locked.
 Only the “UNLOCK” light on the TAIL WHEEL button indicates whether the
 tail wheel is physically locked (“UNLOCK” light will extinguish when locked).

During ground taxi, perform the following:
1. PLT & CPG Wheel brakes – Check in each crew station by applying a slight amount of pressure against the toe
 brakes.
2. PLT / CPG ENG page – Check; ensure NP and NR 101%, all indications green.
3. PLT / CPG FLT page – Check; update altimeter if necessary.
4. PLT Pilot standby instruments – Check; update altimeter if necessary.


Before Takeoff
Perform the following prior to lifting up to a hover or initiating takeoff from the ground:
1. PLT & CPG Weapons systems – Check the following:
 • A/S button – “SAFE” light is illuminated. (see Armament Panel for more information.)
 • GND ORIDE button – Off; “ON” light is not illuminated. (see Armament Panel for more information.)
 • Weapons not actioned – Verify. (see HMD High Action Display for more information.)
2. PLT / CPG TAIL WHEEL button – Verify locked; “UNLOCK” light is not illuminated.
3. PLT PARK BRAKE – As desired (Ensure released unless operating on uneven or sloped terrain).
4. PLT & CPG POWER levers – Ensure both POWER levers are set to FLY.
5. PLT / CPG Systems – Check as follows:

 o Communications – As appropriate; verify on EUFD.
 o Navigation – As appropriate; ensure desired Route or Direct destination is selected.
6. PLT Hover Power Check – Perform. (see Hover Power Check in the next section for more information.)
HOVERING FLIGHT
As a helicopter with a typical operational gross weight between 7.5 to 9.5 tons (7,000 to 8,800 kilograms), a
hovering AH-64D can generate enough rotor wash to cause un-secured items to be tossed into the air at best,
or cause damage to other nearby aircraft at worst. As such, AH-64D aircrews will typically ground taxi to a safe
area before lifting off the ground into a hover or performing a takeoff. If this is not possible, aircrews will
immediately reposition their aircraft to a safe area away from equipment or personnel to minimize the time spent
hovering in any area within which they may incur injury to personnel or damage to other aircraft.




It is important to understand that when raising the collective, the torque effect from the counter-clockwise
rotation of the main rotor will cause the fuselage to spin to the right. This is countered by applying left pedal,
which subsequently results in the aircraft drifting to the right from the combined forces of the main rotor torque
and the tail rotor thrust. This in turn is countered by applying left cyclic to hover with a slight left bank.

Performing a Hover
NVS mode or the searchlight may be used to assist with hovering under low-light conditions, or
 2 1
a combination of both. Initiating a stationary hover from the ground is typically performed in the
following manner:
1. Select Hover symbology mode (Symbology Select switch – Aft). Bob-Up symbology mode
 may also be utilized if desired.
2. Press and hold the force trim (Force Trim/Hold Mode switch – Forward).
3. With the cyclic in the neutral position, increase the collective while simultaneously applying
 left pedal input to counter the torque from the main rotor. Left pedal input will cause the
 aircraft to roll slightly to the right due to the thrust of the tail rotor. A slight left cyclic input
 should be made to counter the tail rotor thrust and keep the fuselage level.
 NOTE: As the aircraft becomes light on the wheels (approximately 20% below the torque required to hover
 in ground effect; HOVER Q – REQUIRED IGE), the force trim may be released if desired to allow Heading
 Hold to engage as the aircraft comes off the “squat” switch (no longer weight-on-wheels).
4. As the aircraft is about to leave the surface, a slight drift in heading may be discerned if the amount of anti-
 torque pedal input is not correctly balanced against the torque of the main rotor. If the heading begins to
 drift to the right, tail rotor thrust is insufficient to counter the torque of the main rotor and additional left
 pedal must be applied. If the heading begins to drift to the left, tail rotor thrust is excessive and left pedal
 input should be reduced slightly.
5. As the aircraft comes off the surface, apply a slight amount of left cyclic to counter translating tendency.
 Adjust the cyclic as required to maintain the position of the helicopter over the surface. Adjust the collective
 as required to maintain altitude over the surface. Adjust the pedals as required to maintain heading.
 NOTE: The combined forces of the main rotor torque and the tail rotor thrust create a sideways translating
 tendency to the right. As a result, the aircraft will normally hover left side low, depending on the additional
 effects of any crosswinds.

 Performing a Hover, In Ground Effect (IGE)
Hover Power Check
Prior to any mission, or after refueling/rearming operations (if feasible), aircrews perform a hover power check
to evaluate their aircraft’s measured hover performance compared to the calculated performance on the MPD
Performance (PERF) page or their pre-mission performance planning.
A hover power check is performed under the following conditions:
 • Aircraft is in a stationary hover in the vicinity of the takeoff area.
 • Aircraft heading is aligned with the intended direction of takeoff.
 • Aircraft altitude is 5 feet AGL.
The aircrew evaluates the following factors during the
hover power check to validate the aircraft performance Current GWT is used to calculate
 REQUIRED torque values
and whether any aspect of their mission may be
impacted:
 2
 • Flight control responsiveness and positions 1
 required to maintain the hover. Abnormal
 control positions may indicate an aircraft
 center-of-gravity (CG) that is out-of-limits. 3
 4
 • A comparison of HOVER Q values on the PERF
 page between the REQUIRED IGE and the
 INDICATED torque values, and whether the
 data matches the pre-mission performance
 planning. This is used to validate whether the
 PERF page is supplying accurate performance
 calculations for use during the mission.
 MAX GWT DE is used to calculate
 • HOVER Q values are used to determine GO-NO/GO torque values
 whether the assessed aircraft performance will
 negatively impact any aspect of the mission.
 • Sufficient fuel is onboard the aircraft for the mission.

 HOVER Q Performance Calculations
TAKEOFF
Several different types of takeoff maneuvers may be performed, depending on the nature of the takeoff area,
obstacles or terrain beyond the takeoff area, and the power margins available. When possible, the crew should
perform a takeoff that ensures the maximum amount of excess power is available for contingencies while
maintaining a safe distance from any potential hazards to the aircraft on climb out, such as vertical hazards or
structures. The four types of takeoffs that may be performed in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC), and their
applications for use, are listed below.




VMC Takeoff. A VMC Takeoff is the most common type of takeoff and can be initiated from the ground or when
already established in a stationary hover. This type of takeoff is used when a sufficient power margin (≥10% TQ)
is available between the torque required to hover in ground effect (HOVER Q – REQUIRED IGE) and the maximum
dual-engine torque available (MAX Q – DE) that does not exceed the dual-engine transmission limit (100% TQ).
VMC Level Acceleration Takeoff. A VMC Level Acceleration Takeoff is considered the safest type of takeoff
but requires a sufficient area that is free of obstacles to permit such a maneuver to be performed. It is preferred
that a sufficient power margin (≥10% TQ) is available to perform this maneuver; but unlike the VMC Takeoff, it
is not necessarily required, depending on the takeoff environment and necessity. The advantage this maneuver
provides is remaining outside the “height-velocity avoid” region until a safe single-engine airspeed can be
attained, in case of an engine failure.
VMC Minimum Power Takeoff. A VMC Minimum Power Takeoff is performed when there is insufficient power
margin (<10% TQ) available between the torque required to hover in ground effect (HOVER Q – REQUIRED IGE)
and the maximum dual-engine torque available (MAX Q – DE) that does not exceed the dual-engine transmission
limit (100% TQ). In such a scenario when the aircraft is hovering near its maximum dual-engine torque available
or its dual-engine transmission limit, this takeoff maneuver is performed. This type of takeoff is used when a
combination of environmental conditions and/or weapon and fuel requirements are negatively impacting the
aircraft’s performance capabilities, but the surface within the takeoff area is unsuitable for a Rolling Takeoff.
Rolling Takeoff. A Rolling Takeoff is performed as the preferred alternative to the VMC Minimum Power Takeoff
when conditions permit. In such a scenario when the aircraft is hovering near its maximum dual-engine torque
available (MAX Q – DE) or its dual-engine transmission limit (100% TQ), and a suitable takeoff area such as a
runway, a road, or other improved surface is available, this takeoff maneuver is performed.
VMC Takeoff
A VMC Takeoff may be performed from the ground or from a stationary hover. When performing 1
 2
the maneuver from the ground, the maneuver is typically performed in the following manner:
1. Select Transition symbology mode (Symbology Select switch – Forward).
2. Press and hold the force trim (Force Trim/Hold Mode switch – Forward).
3. With the cyclic in the neutral position, increase the collective until the aircraft becomes light
 on the wheels while applying left pedal to counter the torque and maintain heading.
 Continue increasing the collective to approximately 10% above the torque required to hover
 in ground effect (HOVER Q – REQUIRED IGE).
 NOTE: A minimum climb rate of 500 feet per minute (FPM) is typically desired. However, depending on the
 nature of the takeoff area, additional torque may be necessary to achieve a higher rate of ascent and a
 steeper climb angle in order to clear obstacles. The Flight Path Vector (FPV) may be used to judge whether
 the aircraft will clear obstacles within the path of the aircraft. (See IHADSS Flight Symbology for more
 information.)
4. As the aircraft leaves the ground, apply forward cyclic to obtain a “90-knot” pitch attitude, which corresponds
 with the Horizon Line bisecting the LOS Reticle within the HDU Flight symbology or the Horizon Line bisecting
 the Waterline symbol on the MPD FLT page. Use forward/aft cyclic inputs as necessary to maintain this level
 pitch attitude as the aircraft accelerates through effective translational lift (ETL). The force trim should be
 held throughout this maneuver if able, but it may be released and pressed intermittently as necessary.
 Use left/right cyclic inputs to maintain the desired ground track and left/right pedal inputs to maintain the
 takeoff heading until the aircraft has ascended through 50 feet AGL or is clear of all obstacles within the
 takeoff area.
 Once the aircraft has climbed above 50 feet AGL and is clear of obstacles, adjust the pedals to place the
 aircraft “in trim” (“Trim ball” centered on the Skid/Slip Indicator).

 VMC Takeoff (from the ground)

When performing a VMC Takeoff from a hover, each step is performed in the same manner as departing from
the ground, except the 90-knot attitude may be achieved at the initiation of the maneuver rather than as the
aircraft leaves the ground.
VMC Level Acceleration Takeoff
A VMC Level Acceleration Takeoff may be performed from the ground or from a stationary hover. 1
When performing the maneuver from the ground, the maneuver is typically performed in the 2

following manner:
1. Select Transition symbology mode (Symbology Select switch – Forward).
2. Press and hold the force trim (Force Trim/Hold Mode switch – Forward).
3. With the cyclic in the neutral position, increase the collective until the aircraft becomes light
 on the wheels while applying left pedal to counter the torque and maintain heading.
 Continue increasing the collective to approximately 10% above the torque required to hover
 in ground effect (HOVER Q – REQUIRED IGE).
 NOTE: Depending on the length of the takeoff area, additional power may be necessary to accelerate and
 achieve the desired climb airspeed within a shorter distance in order to clear obstacles.
4. As the aircraft leaves the ground, apply forward cyclic to maintain the aircraft in ground effect with a level
 VSI. Use forward/aft cyclic inputs as necessary to maintain the VSI at 0 feet per minute (FPM) as the aircraft
 accelerates through minimum safe single-engine airspeed (VSSE). The force trim should be held throughout
 this maneuver if able, but it may be released and pressed intermittently as necessary.
 Use left/right cyclic inputs to maintain the desired ground track and left/right pedal inputs to maintain the
 takeoff heading.
5. As the aircraft accelerates beyond minimum safe single-engine airspeed (VSSE), adjust the cyclic to obtain
 the required pitch attitude for the desired climb airspeed.
 Once the aircraft has climbed above 50 feet AGL and is clear of obstacles, adjust the pedals to place the
 aircraft “in trim” (“Trim ball” centered on the Skid/Slip Indicator).

 VMC Level Acceleration Takeoff (from the ground)

When performing a VMC Level Acceleration Takeoff from a hover, each step is performed in the same manner as
departing from the ground, except the accelerative attitude may be achieved at the initiation of the maneuver
rather than as the aircraft leaves the ground.
VMC Minimum Power Takeoff
A VMC Minimum Power Takeoff may be performed from the ground but is typically performed 1
from a stationary hover after verifying the aircraft has sufficient power to hover in ground effect. 2
When performing the maneuver from a hover, the maneuver is typically performed in the
following manner:
1. Select Transition symbology mode (Symbology Select switch – Forward).
2. Press and hold the force trim (Force Trim/Hold Mode switch – Forward).
3. From a stationary hover, slowly apply forward cyclic to initiate a level acceleration across
 the surface while remaining in ground effect. Increase the collective as necessary, not to
 exceed the maximum dual-engine torque available (MAX Q – DE) or the dual-engine
 transmission limit (100% TQ), whichever is less.
 NOTE: If a hover in ground effect (IGE) at 5 feet AGL can be maintained without exceeding the maximum
 dual-engine torque available or the dual-engine transmission limit, a VMC Minimum Power Takeoff can be
 performed. When training this maneuver, IGE hover power is maintained throughout the maneuver.
 However, during operational missions, any remaining power margin should be utilized without exceeding
 the maximum dual-engine torque available or the dual-engine transmission limit.
4. As the aircraft accelerates through effective translational lift (ETL) and the rotor system becomes more
 efficient at producing lift, the aircraft will begin to ascend. Use forward/aft cyclic inputs as necessary to
 maintain the VSI at 0 feet per minute (FPM) and remain within ground effect. The force trim should be held
 throughout this maneuver if able, but it may be released and pressed intermittently as necessary.
 Use left/right cyclic inputs to maintain the desired ground track and left/right pedal inputs to maintain the
 takeoff heading until the aircraft has ascended through 50 feet AGL or is clear of all obstacles within the
 takeoff area.
5. As the aircraft accelerates beyond minimum safe single-engine airspeed (VSSE), adjust the cyclic to obtain
 the required pitch attitude for the desired climb airspeed.
 Once the aircraft has climbed above 50 feet AGL and is clear of obstacles, adjust the pedals to place the
 aircraft “in trim” (“Trim ball” centered on the Skid/Slip Indicator).

 VMC Minimum Power Takeoff
Rolling Takeoff
A Rolling Takeoff is performed when the aircraft’s power margin is insufficient (<10% below maximum dual-
engine torque; MAX Q – DE) to perform a normal takeoff and a suitable takeoff area such as a runway, a road,
or other improved surface is available. The maneuver is typically performed in the following manner:
1. Manually set the stabilator angle to 0° (Stabilator Control Switch on the 2
 Collective Flight Grip), as indicated on the ENG Systems sub-page. 1 3


2. Select Transition symbology mode (Symbology Select switch – Forward).
3. Press and hold the force trim (Force Trim/Hold Mode switch – Forward).
4. With the cyclic in the neutral position, increase the collective to 30-35% TQ.
5. Apply forward cyclic to begin the takeoff roll while progressively increasing
 collective to approximately 3-5% below the maximum dual-engine torque
 available (MAX Q – DE). As the tail comes off the surface, use forward/aft
 cyclic inputs to achieve and maintain a level, 90-knot attitude.
 NOTE: When training this maneuver, increase the collective to 10% below the torque required to hover in
 ground effect (HOVER Q – REQUIRED IGE) to simulate a limited-power condition.
 Apply left pedal to counter the torque and then left/right pedal inputs as necessary to maintain heading.
 Use left/right cyclic inputs to maintain the ground track across the takeoff surface. The force trim should be
 held throughout this maneuver if able, but it may be released and pressed intermittently as necessary.
6. As the aircraft accelerates and the rotor system becomes more efficient at producing lift, the aircraft will
 become light on the wheels. Use forward/aft cyclic inputs as necessary to maintain the level, 90-knot attitude
 until the aircraft lifts off the surface. After liftoff, use forward/aft cyclic inputs to remain within ground effect
 with the VSI at 0 feet per minute (FPM) as the aircraft continues to accelerate.
 Once the aircraft has lifted off the surface, adjust the pedals to place the aircraft “in trim” (“Trim ball”
 centered on the Skid/Slip Indicator) while using left/right cyclic inputs to maintain the desired ground track
 within the takeoff area.

 Rolling Takeoff
LANDING
Several different types of landing maneuvers may be performed, depending on the nature of the landing area,
obstacles near the landing area, and the power margins available. When possible, the crew should perform an
approach that ensures the maximum amount of excess power is available for performing a go-around while
maintaining a safe distance from any potential hazards to the aircraft, such as vertical hazards or structures.




VMC Approach. A VMC Approach is normally performed when sufficient power margins allow for normal
approach angles and deceleration prior to arriving over the intended point of touchdown. Variations in the
execution of the VMC Approach are based on the nature of the landing area, obstacles around the landing area,
and the whether the aircraft has the power margins to hover out of ground effect (OGE).
Roll-on Landing. A Roll-on Landing may be performed when insufficient power exists to perform a normal VMC
Approach. In such a scenario when the aircraft hover performance is calculated to be near its maximum dual-
engine torque available (MAX Q – DE) or its dual-engine transmission limit (100% TQ), and a suitable landing
area such as a runway, a road, or other improved surface is available, this landing maneuver is performed.


Before Landing
Prior to landing, perform the following:
1. PLT & CPG Weapons systems – Check the following:
 • A/S button – “SAFE” light is illuminated. (see Armament Panel for more information.)
 • GND ORIDE button – Off; “ON” light is not illuminated. (see Armament Panel for more information.)
 • Weapons not actioned – Verify. (see HMD High Action Display for more information.)
2. PLT / CPG ASE – As required.
3. PLT / CPG TAIL WHEEL button – Verify locked; “UNLOCK” light is not illuminated.
4. PLT PARK BRAKE – Ensure brakes are released, PARK BRAKE handle is inward.
VMC Approach
A VMC Approach may be performed to the ground or to a stationary hover. When performing the maneuver to
the ground, the maneuver is typically performed in the following manner:
1. Select Transition symbology mode (Symbology Select switch – Forward) and place the LOS 1
 Reticle on the intended point of touchdown. (see IHADSS Flight Symbology for more 2

 information.)
2. Press and hold the force trim (Force Trim/Hold Mode switch – Forward).
3. When the desired approach angle is intercepted (whether on final or while still in a base
 turn toward the landing area), decrease the collective so that the Flight Path Vector (FPV)
 is aligned with the intended point of touchdown when on the final approach course. Apply
 aft cyclic to initiate a deceleration at a rate appropriate for the remaining distance to
 touchdown. Adjust the pedals to maintain the aircraft “in trim”. (“Trim ball” centered on the
 Skid/Slip Indicator).
 NOTE: Steep approach angles should only be utilized if adequate power is available to maintain a slow rate
 of descent, or if the aircraft performance is such that a hover out of ground effect (OGE) may be performed.
4. Use left/right cyclic inputs to maintain the desired ground track. Use forward/aft cyclic inputs to progressively
 decelerate so that the Velocity Vector arrives at the center of the LOS Reticle as the aircraft arrives at the
 intended point of touchdown, effectively reaching zero forward velocity as the aircraft touches down.
5. As the aircraft descends below 50 feet AGL or below the obstacles surrounding the landing area, adjust the
 pedals to align the aircraft with the landing direction.
6. Once the aircraft touches down, lower the collective to 27-30% torque and adjust the cyclic to eliminate any
 remaining velocity. Once the aircraft is stationary, neutralize the cyclic and fully lower the collective.

 VMC Approach (to the ground)

When performing a VMC Approach to a hover, each step is performed in the same manner as an approach to the
ground, except the forward velocity and vertical speed are reduced to zero prior to contact with the ground. A
VMC Approach may be terminated to a hover in ground effect (IGE) or out of ground effect (OGE), but the aircraft
performance must be adequately calculated when terminating to an OGE hover to avoid settling with power.
Roll-on Landing
A Roll-on Landing is performed when the aircraft’s power margin is insufficient to perform a normal approach
and a suitable landing area such as a runway, a road, or other improved surface is available. The maneuver is
typically performed in the following manner:
1. Select Transition symbology mode (Symbology Select switch – Forward) and place the LOS 1
 Reticle on the intended point of touchdown. (see IHADSS Flight Symbology for more 2

 information.)
2. Press and hold the force trim (Force Trim/Hold Mode switch – Forward).
3. When the desired approach angle is intercepted (whether on final or while still in a base
 turn toward the landing area), decrease the collective so that the Flight Path Vector (FPV)
 is aligned with the intended point of touchdown when on the final approach course. Apply
 aft cyclic to initiate a deceleration at a rate appropriate for the remaining distance to
 touchdown. Adjust the pedals to maintain the aircraft “in trim”. (“Trim ball” centered on the
 Skid/Slip Indicator).
4. Use left/right cyclic inputs to maintain the desired ground track and left/right pedal inputs to maintain the
 aircraft “in trim”. Adjust the cyclic throughout the approach to progressively decelerate so that the aircraft
 remains above ETL (24 knots) until 10-20 feet AGL over the landing area.
 NOTE: If performing an approach under single-engine power, do not decelerate below Velocity Safe Single
 Engine (VSSE) until 10-20 feet AGL over the landing area. (see PERF page for more information.)
5. As the aircraft descends below 50 feet AGL or below the obstacles surrounding the landing area, adjust the
 pedals to align the aircraft with the landing direction.
6. If possible, adjust the attitude to ensure the aircraft touches down on all three wheels at once to avoid
 excessive loads on the tail wheel. After touchdown, use left/right cyclic inputs to maintain the ground track
 across the landing surface and left/right pedal inputs to maintain heading.
7. Lower the collective to a minimum of 30% torque (60% torque if under single-engine power) and apply aft
 cyclic to aerodynamically decelerate, and/or apply wheel brakes. Once the aircraft is stationary, neutralize
 the cyclic and fully lower the collective.

 Roll-on Landing
AIRCRAFT SHUTDOWN
Just as with departing from its parking location and taxiing to the takeoff area, the AH-64 may perform hover
taxi (<25 feet and <20 knots) or air taxi (<100 feet and/or >20 knots) to transition back to the parking area
after landing, but ground taxi is typically used when feasible.




Once clear of the active runway or designated arrival/departure area, the transponder is typically set to standby
and the exterior lights are set in accordance with local regulations and procedures. As the aircraft is arriving to
the designated parking location and in the intended parking heading, it is necessary to straighten the aircraft’s
direction of travel for a short distance to allow the free-rotating tail wheel to align with the locking actuator. Once
the tail wheel has been successfully locked (indicated by the “UNLOCK” light on the TAIL WHEEL button
extinguishing), the aircraft can be brought to a stop. (see Ground Taxi for more information.)
The aircraft may be aerodynamically braked using aft cyclic input with 27-30% torque applied, or the wheel
brakes may be used in either crewstation. After coming to a halt, the Pilot should set the wheel brakes using the
PARK BRAKE handle. (see Parking Brake Handle for more information.)


After Landing Check
After landing, perform the following:
1. PLT / CPG TAIL WHEEL button – Unlock as necessary for ground taxi.
2. PLT EXT LT – Set exterior lighting in accordance with local procedures.
3. PLT / CPG Avionics – As desired (COM page).
 • Transponder – STBY.
 • Communications – As appropriate; verify on EUFD.

NAVIGATION




 NAVIGATION
NAVIGATION
The AH-64D primarily navigates by utilizing a pair of Embedded GPS/Inertial Navigation Units (EGI) aided by a
Doppler velocity radar and a database of stored points. After the APU is started and generator power is applied
to the aircraft, both EGI’s will automatically begin their alignment process. Aircrew intervention is normally not
required aside from verifying the EGI’s alignment status and velocity indications prior to engine start.
Unless updated with a new position via the DTC, the EGI alignment process uses the aircraft’s previous position
and heading stored in the aircraft memory from when it was last shut down. This stored position, aided by GPS
position signals, shortens the alignment process considerably, allowing an AH-64D to takeoff within minutes if
necessary.

 Navigational Sensors

While in flight, the AH-64D receives continuous position updates from GPS satellites to maintain INU position
confidence and aid in precision navigation. As an emergency back-up during operations in low-visibility conditions,
the AH-64D is equipped with an AN/ARN-149 Automatic Direction Finder.
The AH-64D uses true airspeed calculations derived from the pitot probe mounted on the leading edge of the left
wing and the static ports on each side of the airframe. These, along with the air data sensors, aid in more precise
ballistic calculations during weapons delivery and are the primary source of air mass data to the Flight
Management Computer (FMC).
A set of backup instruments are installed within the Pilot’s crewstation that provide indicated airspeed and
barometric altitude from the second pitot probe mounted on the leading edge of the right wing and each static
port. A standby attitude indicator and a backup magnetic compass is also installed within the Pilot’s crewstation.
POINTS
The AH-64D’s navigational database consists of 149 unique point files that can be uploaded from a removable
Data Transfer Cartridge (DTC), with an additional 6 non-loadable point files within the aircraft memory. These
point files serve as geographical coordinates of waypoints for navigation and routing, hazards to flight that should
be avoided, control measures that are used for battlefield coordination and maneuvers, locations of friendly and
enemy forces, and known or suspected locations of hostile air defenses.




Point files within the navigational database are stored in one of three partitions, depending on their type. Points
within these partitions may be uploaded from the DTC; and may be added, edited, or deleted from the cockpit.

 General Control Measures
 Waypoints Friendly Control Measures Targets
 Hazards Enemy Control Measures Threats Terrain



 Point Database Partitions

• Waypoints/Hazards (WPTHZ) partition. Points for depicting navigation waypoints and hazards.
• Control Measures (CTRLM) partition. Points for depicting friendly and enemy units, airfields, and other
 graphical control measures for controlling team movements and coordinating with other friendly forces
 during a mission.
• Targets/Threats (TGT/THRT) partition. Points for depicting targets and threats, along with
 corresponding detection/engagement rings.
• Targets/Threats (TGT/THRT) extended partition. Points for storing additional TSD file locations, such
 as the Pilot and CPG Terrain (TRN) points. The Pilot’s TRN point is indexed as T55 and the CPG’s TRN point
 is indexed as T56.
The Target/Threats extended partition only resides within the aircraft memory and cannot be edited by the DTC.
Point Files
Each point file contains five elements of information, which includes the file location within the database, the
three-dimensional location of the point, the symbol that is displayed on the TSD at the point’s location, and up
to three unique alphanumeric characters that may be associated with the point, such as a name or designation.
• Point Index (W##, H##, C##, T##). Each point is indexed within the partition it resides, and the index
 itself is used to reference the point when performing tasks such as reviewing the points information, setting
 the point as an acquisition source, adding the point to a route, panning the TSD to its location, etc.
 o Waypoints. All points of the Waypoint type are indexed within the WPTHZ partition with a leading
 “W” followed by two digits between 1 and 50 (e.g. “W01”), which are shared with Hazards.
 o Hazards. All points of the Hazard type are indexed within the WPTHZ partition with a leading “H”
 followed by two digits between 1 and 50 (e.g. “H01”), which are shared with Waypoints.
 o Control Measures. All points of the Control Measure type are indexed within the CTRLM partition
 with a leading “C” followed by two digits between 51 and 99 (e.g. “C51”).
 o Targets/Threats. All points of the Targets/Threats type are indexed within the TGT/THRT
 partition with a leading “T” followed by two digits between 1 and 50 (e.g. “T01”). Targets/Threats
 occupy points 100-149 within the database, but are renamed to T01-T50 for presentation to the
 crew.
 The first 25 points within the WPTHZ and TGT/THRT partitions that are loaded by the DTC are considered
 “safe sets” and cannot be overridden using the STO functions on the TSD Point sub-page or by the CPG
 using the STORE/UPDT switch on the TEDAC Left Handgrip. However, Waypoints, Hazards, or
 Targets/Threats within the “safe sets” may be manually deleted from the cockpit. Once a point is deleted
 from a “safe set”, the point may be overridden at any time in the flight unless the original point is re-loaded
 from the DTC.
• Identifier (IDENT). A point’s identifier determines the symbol which is displayed at the point’s location on
 the TSD. 140 different symbols may be chosen, which are identified within the point file using a 1- or 2-digit
 alphanumeric code.
 Most identifiers are only valid when used with a specific point type. As an example, the Communications
 Checkpoint identifier of “CC” will only be accepted if the point type was set to Waypoint. However, several
 identifiers are used by multiple point types and will contextually display different symbols based on which
 point type was set prior to adding the point. As an example, if the point type was set to Control Measure
 and “BP” was entered as the identifier, a Battle Position symbol would be displayed; whereas if the point
 type was set to Target/Threat, a Blowpipe threat symbol would be displayed.
• Free Text (FREE). A point’s free text may contain up to 3 alphanumeric characters that may be added to
 the point for additional context as to the nature of the location. If no free text is entered, the free text will
 simply repeat the point index (e.g. “W01”).
• Coordinates (UTM LAT/LONG). A point’s coordinates is saved in both the MGRS and Latitude/Longitude
 coordinate systems. When a new point is added, or an existing point’s coordinates is edited, the point may
 be entered in either MGRS 8-digit format or Latitude/Longitude “Degrees, Minutes, Decimals” format
 (DD°MM.MM DDD°MM.MM), but the coordinates will automatically be converted to the opposite format
 when the coordinates are saved into the point file.
• Altitude above mean sea level (ALTITUDE). A point’s altitude is saved in feet, based on the altitude
 above mean sea level (MSL).
 Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) is typically loaded into the aircraft navigational database. When a new
 point is added, the altitude will always default to the terrain elevation based on the coordinates already
 saved within the point file. However, a different altitude may be entered if desired, which will place the point
 above (or below) the actual terrain elevation. This may be useful when inputting a route in which the points
 are desired to be displayed at specific altitudes, such as GPS approach waypoints or illumination rockets.
Choosing a Point Identifier
When adding a point during mission planning or while in the aircraft, there are many different types of point
symbols that may be selected from the list of 140 abbreviated identifier codes. Choosing the appropriate identifier
may be affected by several factors, such as the purpose of the point, the database partition the point will be
saved within, whether the point will be stored within a “safe set”, or whether the point displays its free text
directly on TSD alongside its symbol.
• Purpose. Choosing a point symbol based on the purpose of the point itself is useful in providing an
 immediate context to the crewmembers when viewing the TSD. For example, using a Landing Zone symbol
 in place of a generic Waypoint symbol allows the crew to immediately recognize what type of location that
 point represents when viewing the TSD with a quick glance.
• Partition. At times, choosing a point symbol may be predicated on whether a specific partition still contains
 empty point files that are available for use. As an example, entering enemy unit locations as Targets during
 pre-mission planning may quickly fill the TGT/THRT partition, leaving few empty point files available during
 the mission to store target locations observed within the TADS. Alternatively, many enemy locations may be
 stored as enemy control measure symbols.
• Safe Set. Only the first 25 points in the WPTHZ and TGT/THRT partitions contain a “safe set” that is
 protected from accidental overwriting within the cockpit. As such, it may be desired to place certain
 waypoints within either of these safe set locations to preserve their data during the mission. As an example,
 it may be desired to load anticipated enemy air defense locations into the first 25 points within the TGT/THRT
 partition to ensure their locations are not overwritten when the CPG stores targets via the TADS. Another
 example may be placing any significant hazards (like towers or wires) that are expected to be encountered
 during low-level night operations may be loaded into the first 25 points within the WPTHZ partition.
• Free Text. Most types of control measures will display the 3-character free text alongside their point symbol
 in lieu of their point index. Under some circumstances, it may be preferable to utilize these types of points
 if it is desired to leverage the free text itself in describing the nature of the location, even if the icon itself
 doesn’t correlate with the terrain or situation.
 In the example to the right, LZ “Falcon” is
 marked by a Landing Zone point on the left, and
 a Ground Light point on the right. A Landing
 Zone point will not display its free text of “FAL”
 directly on the TSD, but it can be viewed by
 entering the TSD Point sub-page and then
 selecting the point using the cursor to review its
 information. On the other hand, the Ground
 Light point displays its free text “FAL” directly
 on the TSD, but it may not be known by the Landing Zone (Left) and
 crew that this point represents an LZ location Ground Light (Right) point symbols
 unless briefed as such.
 In this situation, it is a question of what the location means versus how it is labeled. This question of context
 should be taken into consideration when planning a mission in which other players may not be aware of the
 intent behind which points are being used for specific purposes.
Waypoints/Hazards (WPTHZ)
The Waypoints/Hazards partition includes graphics for depicting generic waypoints, communications checkpoints,
start and release points of routes, and hazards such as towers or wires. Some of the more commonly used
Waypoints/Hazards are shown below.




 Waypoint Start Point Release Point Tower <1000’ Wires, Power

 Examples of Waypoint/Hazard Symbols


When a WPTHZ point file is set to an identifier that corresponds with a hazard, the point file is presented to the
crew as “H##” rather than “W##”, even though the point files are within the same partition.

It is important to note that hazards are always perpendicular to the flight path of the aircraft on the TSD and do
not depict the actual direction of the hazard, but its general location only. This is especially important to remember
regarding linear hazards such as wires.

Control Measures (CTRLM)
Control measures include graphics for depicting friendly and enemy units, Forward Arming and Refueling Points
(FARPS), battle positions, and others. Some of the more commonly used Control Measures are shown below.




 Airfield Battle Position Checkpoint Ground Light Friendly Infantry Enemy Armor

 Examples of Control Measure Symbols


Targets/Threats (TGT/THRT)
Targets/Threats include symbols for depicting the location of targets found during the conduct of a mission or
for depicting the location of known or templated air defense systems.




 Target Point 2S6 SA-8 SA-15 ZSU-23-4 Radar

 Examples of Target/Threat Symbols


When a point is entered as an air defense threat, rings depicting the detection and/or engagement ranges of the
corresponding air defense system may be displayed on the TSD. The display of threat rings may be
enabled/disabled on the TSD Threat Show (THRT SHOW) sub-page.

A complete list of point types and their symbols can be found on the TSD Abbreviation (ABR) sub-page or in
Appendix C of this manual.

Adding a Point using MPD Cursor
A new point may be added to the TSD quickly by selecting the desired point type (VAB L3-L6) and then “dropping”
the point onto the TSD at the desired location. However, if the “cursor drop” method is used to add a point, only
the point type may be selected and no further point file data may be entered. The default points that are dropped
at the cursor location are shown below, based on the selected point type.

 • Waypoint (WP)

 • Tower Under 1000’ (TU)
 3. ADD (VAB L2)
 • Checkpoint (CP)

 • Target point (TG)

When these points are “dropped”, the free text 5. MPD Cursor Slew

Storing a Point using CPG Sight (TADS)
A new point may be stored to the TSD using the TADS line-of-sight. Although an automatic or manual range may
be used if necessary, a laser range will provide the best precision when storing a point using the TADS.
NOTE: The CPG may store a Target (TG) point at the TADS line-of-sight and current range source any time the
TADS is the selected sight and the STORE/UPDT switch on the TEDAC Left Handgrip is momentarily set to the
STORE position. The TSD is not required to be displayed and set to the STO sub-page to perform this action.
Although this method allows targets to be
stored more quickly by excluding steps 3

ROUTES
The AH-64D navigational database can store 10 unique routes, each consisting of up to 100 point entries. Route
sequences may consist of any combination of Waypoints/Hazards and Control Measures, but may not include any
points from the Targets/Threats partition. However, “direct” routes may be plotted from the aircraft’s current
position to any point file within the database at any time, to include Targets/Threats.




Routes typically consist of a Start Point (SP) and end with a Release Point (RP). When planning a mission, it is
useful to have multiple ingress and egress routes to and from the objective area. A route should not be considered
a flight plan, but rather an avenue to reach the objective area, reposition to different sectors of the battlefield,
or a method to control multiple flights of aircraft. As such, most route points are not required to be directly
overflown.
In the example below, a basic route is shown on the TSD that includes a Start Point, a Communications
Checkpoint, a standard Waypoint, a Release Point, and a solid green line linking each point within the route.




 Route Structure and Format

If a non-frozen TSD is not displayed on an MPD within either crewstation, the EUFDs will display “WAYPOINT
APPROACH” in the advisory column to alert the crew of an impending turn to the next route point. This advisory
will display when the estimated time enroute (ETE) to that route point is 60 seconds at the current ground speed.
When passing the route point, even if the aircraft does not directly overfly it, the next route point is automatically
set as the new destination and “WAYPOINT PASSAGE” is displayed on the EUFD for 90 seconds.
TSD Route (RTE) Sub-page
The RTE sub-page is used to review information regarding the current route and its points, plot a direct route to
a different point in the route or any point outside of the current route sequence, or edit the current route by
adding or deleting points from the route sequence. Routes themselves may be selected or deleted entirely from
the TSD Route Menu sub-page.
NOTE: If a point is deleted from a route sequence, it is not removed from the navigational database. Point files
may only be deleted from the database using the TSD Point sub-page.
By default, the current route is only displayed on the TSD page when set to NAV phase, or any time the RTE sub-
page is displayed. However, the current route may be enabled for display on the TSD in the ATK phase if desired.

 distance from the ownship position to the reviewed point and the current ground speed.

 • Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA). The estimated time of arrival at the reviewed point, based on the
 current system time and the estimated time enroute (ETE). The ETA time format (Local or Zulu) is
 based on the system time format selected on the TSD Utility sub-page.

 When a direct route is created to any point file, the ETA will be calculated based on the straight-line
 distance from the ownship position to the reviewed point and the current ground speed.

 • Distance to Point (KM). The combined distance, in kilometers, from the ownship position to the next
 point within the route sequence, and each subsequent route leg, until arrival at the reviewed point.

 When a direct route is created to any point file, the distance will be calculated as a straight-line distance
 from the ownship position to the reviewed point.

 • Distance to Point (NM). The combined distance, in nautical miles, from the ownship position to the
 next point within the route sequence, and each subsequent route leg, until arrival at the reviewed

Creating a Route using the Mission Editor
When using the Mission Editor, waypoints placed on the map from the Helicopter Group’s Route tab will auto-
populate into the DCS: AH-64D as the default TSD route sequence, Route “ALPHA”. Each waypoint following the
initial Helicopter Group position (waypoint 0) will be displayed as a Waypoint (WP) on the TSD, as part of Route
“ALPHA”, and numbered in accordance with their sequence within the Mission Editor.
NOTE: It is currently only possible to generate one route in the Mission Editor. The remaining nine routes on the
Route Menu (RTM) sub-page will be empty of any points. However, points may be added to the remaining routes
from the cockpit, if desired, after the mission starts.




 Initial position of Helicopter Group




 WP02 in Route “ALPHA”




 WP03 in Route “ALPHA”
 WP01 in Route “ALPHA”




 Mission Editor – Helicopter Group Route

Point files within the AH-64D’s navigational database are input and displayed in three dimensions, therefore it
may be advisable to set the altitude of all waypoints within the Mission Editor to the minimum value, which
corresponds with ground level; especially if intended to mark a specific location or landmark. However, under
certain circumstances it may be useful to place them at altitudes above ground, depending on how they are
intended to be utilized during the mission. This may be useful to mark locations over the battlefield for illumination
rockets or to build 3-dimensional instrument approaches during low-visibility conditions.
Creating a Route using the Route (RTE) sub-page
When creating a new route, an empty route should be selected on the TSD Route Menu sub-page. After an empty
route has been selected, it may be necessary pan the TSD to the first point to be added to the route, and any
subsequent points, if not currently located within the viewable TSD footprint. Alternatively, if the point file indexes
of the points are known, they may be manually input using the Keyboard Unit (KU).
NOTE: Routes may only be created or
modified using existing points within the
navigational database, which cannot be added
from the TSD Route sub-page. (See TSD Point 4. POINT> (VAB L1)

RADIO NAVIGATION
IN LOW-VISIBILITY CONDITIONS
Although the AH-64D was not designed to perform flight within Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC), it
can perform limited navigation under such conditions with on-board equipment. This equipment primarily includes
the AN/ARN-149 Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) receiver, the Instruments (INST) sub-page of the TSD, along
with the associated navigation symbology on the Flight (FLT) page and in the IHADSS Flight symbology.




The AN/ARN-49 ADF is a radio navigation receiver with a directional antenna that can determine a coarse azimuth
to an AM radio signal within the frequency range of 100.0 to 2199.5 kHz. Audio from AM radio signals received
within this frequency range may also be monitored by the crew using the ADF audio channel of the ICS system.
The ADF receiver is controlled through the TSD Instruments (INST) sub-page on the TSD. The INST sub-page
format enables the crew to determine relative bearings from known Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) stations; and
integrates the radio navigation equipment with the existing functionality of the TSD moving map, routes, points
database, waypoint status, winds, and endurance data.
(See the TSD Instruments sub-page for more information.)
Setting the Color Band Shading to “A/C” on the TSD Map sub-page may aid in maintaining clearance above terrain
and obstacles when operating in low-visibility conditions.
NOTE: The Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) utilizes the ADF audio channel of the ICS to provide missile
threat warnings to the crew. To monitor the ADF receiver audio, the CMWS/NAV switch must be set to the NAV
position on the CMWS Control Panel, which is located in the Pilot crewstation.
TSD Instruments (INST) Sub-page
The INST sub-page of the Tactical Situation Display is a sub-page optimized for radio navigation and includes
controls for the AN/ARN-149 Automatic Direction Finder (ADF).
Any time the INST sub-page is displayed, the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) will be displayed around the
Ownship, regardless of whether the crewmember has enabled the HSI for display on the TSD SHOW sub-page.
NOTE: If the ARN-149 ADF receiver is not powered on the INST Utility sub-page, the following items will not be
displayed on the INST sub-page.
 • ADF Frequency (VAB L3) • ADF Tone (VAB R4)
 • Last ADF Frequency (VAB L5) • ADF Identification (VAB R5)
 • ADF Status Window • ADF Test (VAB R6)
 • ADF Bearing Pointer

RADIO
COMMUNICATIONS




RADIO COMMUNICATIONS
RADIO COMMUNICATIONS
The AH-64D’s communications systems are fully integrated into the avionics, allowing either crewmember to
interact with and use any radio onboard the aircraft through the EUFD and MPD controls.



 ARC-186(V) VHF /
 ARC-201D FM1 Antenna


 ARC-220 HF Antenna




 ARC-164(V) UHF Antenna ARC-201D FM2 Antenna




 Radio Communications Equipment

The ARC-186(V) VHF radio provides two-way line-of-sight communications over VHF-AM frequencies and is
normally used for communicating with Air Traffic Control (ATC). The radio is not capable of secure
communications. Its antenna is located on the top of the cambered fin.
The ARC-164(V) UHF radio provides two-way line-of-sight communications over UHF-AM frequencies and is
normally used for communicating with ATC, other aircraft, or ground forces. The radio contains an additional
receiver tuned to the GUARD frequency of 243.0 MHz, the ability to communicate on HAVE QUICK frequency-
hopping nets, and can be connected to a KY-58 module for secure communications. Its antenna is located on the
underside of the tail boom, aft of the navigational sponson containing the Doppler velocity and radar altimeter
antennas.
Two ARC-201D SINCGARS (Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System) radio sets provide two-way line-
of-sight communications over VHF-FM frequencies and are normally used for communicating with ground forces
and other AH-64 team members. Both radios have embedded secure communications capability and can
communicate on frequency-hopping nets. The FM1 radio shares the tail-mounted whip antenna with the VHF
radio, and the FM2 antenna is located on the underside of the tail boom, forward of the navigational sponson.
The FM1 radio is paired with an Improved FM (IFM) amplifier which can vary the output power of the radio.
The ARC-220 HF radio provides two-way, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and over-the-horizon (OTH) communications
over shortwave frequencies. The radio has an embedded modem for sending and receiving data transmissions,
can operate using frequency-hopping nets, and can be connected to a KY-100 module for secure communications
capability. The ARC-220 is also capable of communications using Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) multi-
channel nets to decrease crew workload and increase communications reliability. The HF radio utilizes a near-
vertical incidence skywave (NVIS) type antenna which runs along the right side of the tail boom and is paired
with a dedicated amplifier which can vary the output power of the radio.
Communications Architecture
The operation of the AH-64D’s communications system is designed for use in combat, in which the expected
nature of the mission involves the employment of teams, platoons, or entire companies of AH-64D’s against
conventional ground forces. The architecture of the communications system integrates voice and data networks
into a single interface and is optimized for pre-planned operations; but remains sufficiently flexible to respond to
a rapidly evolving battlefield or last-minute changes in the mission.

The architecture of the AH-64D communications interface Communications Preset COM page (Preset format)
primarily revolves around the use of “presets”. Up to 10 presets
may be accessed on the COM page at any given time. Unlike Unit ID PRESET EDIT sub-page
singular preset frequencies that may be selected from a physical
 Callsign PRESET EDIT sub-page
radio control panel, each preset within the AH-64D includes:

 that are intended to be used during the mission. Communications Preset Architecture
• A list of flight members that may send/receive data through the datalink network associated with that preset.
• Modem settings used when sending/receiving data over the datalink network associated with that preset.
When one of the ten presets are selected on the main COM page, the COM page is displayed in Preset format,
which presents information pertinent to that preset, such as the unit ID, callsign, and frequencies, and allows
that preset to be tuned (which will also configure the datalink according to the network and modem settings).
If desired, the crewmember may edit details or frequencies of the preset itself by accessing the PRESET EDIT
sub-page. Additionally, the network members of the preset may be edited on the NET sub-page, and the modem
settings on the MODEM sub-page. (See the Datalink chapter for more information regarding datalink network
and modem settings.)
Communications Controls
The aircrew interacts with and controls the communications equipment using a combination of the Multi-Purpose
Displays (MPD), the Enhanced Upfront Display (EUFD), and the Communications Panel located within each
cockpit. (See the COM page for more information regarding MPD controls.)

Manually Tuning a Radio
If necessary, the radios may be manually tuned to a frequency that is not included within a programmed preset.
However, manually tuning a radio will also remove any datalink capability through that radio. When a radio is
manually tuned, the Callsign list on the EUFD will display “MAN” to the right of the corresponding frequency.
When a manual frequency is entered, it is always assigned in the primary slot of the corresponding radio, which
will be immediately tuned to the frequency. The preset that is already in the primary slot will be transferred to
the standby slot. This allows any unplanned radio communications over the manual frequency to occur
immediately, which may be time critical due to a change in mission or rapid changes on the battlefield; but also
allows the aircrew to just as easily return to the previous preset (and datalink network) prior to the radio being
manually tuned.

TACTICAL EMPLOYMENT




TACTICAL EMPLOYMENT
ATTACK HELICOPTERS IN COMBAT
The most basic description of an attack helicopter is a rotary-winged aircraft that is specifically equipped with
weapons and munitions to destroy targets on the battlefield. For attack helicopters that are designed to engage
medium and heavy armor units, a common euphemism to describe such helicopters is a “flying tank”. While this
may convey the relative lethality these attack helicopters possess when compared to a main battle tank, it often
lends itself to a misconception that attack helicopters are bulletproof or can withstand enormous amounts of
punishment while continuing to engage enemy forces.




 FLYING TANK FLYING TANK




Although most attack helicopters are armored or reinforced against various calibers of weapons fire, such
protection is only in the most critical areas of the airframe. Extra armor equates to additional weight, which
hinders performance of the aircraft itself, as well as reducing the amount of fuel or weapons the helicopter can
carry to the fight. Because of this limitation, armored protection is prioritized for the most critical components (to
include the aircrew), with system redundancy and crashworthiness making up the remainder of the aircraft
resistance to hostile fire.
Such redundancy and crashworthiness are implemented to ensure crew survival and recovery of the airframe to
friendly locations for repairs. While “fighting to the death” as shown in the movies may seem worthwhile to
achieve immediate mission results, in reality it hinders the long-term strategic objectives of a military conflict. An
attack helicopter, by its nature as an airborne weapons system, can
achieve something that similarly armed ground vehicles cannot:
mobility and speed across any terrain or obstacle. This speed and
the ability to traverse any terrain by simply flying above it means an
attack helicopter can more easily attack targets behind enemy lines,
engage targets that are beyond the reach of friendly artillery,
perform reconnaissance and screening operations in areas that
ground vehicles cannot, and more rapidly respond to changes on the
battlefield in real-time.
Attack helicopters can be employed independently of ground forces
to shape the battlefield ahead of friendly ground offensives.
Alternatively, they may be employed in conjunction with ground
forces to mass fires against the enemy at decisive points in a battle;
or used as close-in security to protect friendly ground forces from
hostile attack. Depending on which country or branch of service an
attack helicopter originates, such units are employed as either Close
Air Support (CAS) aircraft or as “maneuver units” (much in the same
manner infantry or armor units are employed in conventional YAH-64A (US Army)
maneuver warfare).

In the CAS role, one key difference between attack helicopters and most fixed-wing attack aircraft is the economy
of firepower. Fixed-wing attack aircraft may be able to physically carry a much greater payload of munitions as
far as pure tonnage is concerned, but purpose-built attack helicopters are often equipped with a greater number
of smaller munitions that are accurate and highly effective against various types of ground vehicles.
 In addition, most attack helicopters are also equipped
 with machine guns or medium-caliber automatic
 cannons coupled with highly accurate fire control
 systems that can engage or suppress ground forces at
 close ranges, as well as unguided rocket systems for
 large area suppression. Most modern attack helicopters
 are quite capable of employing all of these weapon
 systems against multiple targets within a short time
 span, without the time needed by fixed-wing attack
 aircraft to reorient between attack runs against
 successive targets. This persistence of fire allows attack
 helicopters to maintain pressure on enemy forces in a
 manner that cannot be matched by fixed-wing aircraft.



 Pre-production AH-64A (US Army)
Mobility, Standoff, and Planning
 The primary advantage of a helicopter on the battlefield
 when compared to their ground vehicle counterparts is
 their ability to cover distances across any terrain within a
 short amount of time. This battlefield mobility allows
 helicopters to rapidly move troops and equipment to the
 rear of enemy echelons, rapidly resupply or reinforce
 dispersed units, evacuate wounded soldiers to receive
 medical treatment, respond to enemy attacks on flanks of
 friendly units, respond to calls for fire support along the
 front line, or exploit targets of opportunity beyond the
 front line.
As discussed above, helicopters are still quite vulnerable to enemy weapons fire. When hovering or flying at low-
speed, helicopters are vulnerable to engagement by ATGM’s or even a tank’s main gun. The primary method for
attack helicopters to mitigate such threat weapons is standoff. Whenever possible, an attack helicopter aircrew
should always choose a battle position that places the enemy within the maximum effective range of their
weapons, while remaining outside the maximum effective range of the enemy’s. When standoff cannot be
maintained due to changes on the battlefield, the aircrew can utilize the attack helicopter’s mobility to rapidly re-
position the attack helicopter to regain and maintain that standoff for as long as possible. This maximizes the
attack helicopter’s lethality against the enemy, while minimizing the enemy’s ability to engage it.
A key part in maintaining standoff from enemy forces, especially in situations where enemy positions are not well
known, is planning. Even before climbing into the cockpit, air routes, terrain, suspected/known enemy positions,
enemy weapon systems, and even the weather, should all be evaluated to understand how each factor will affect
the aircrew’s ability to maintain standoff or remain masked behind terrain from the enemy. However, even with
a thorough plan, discretion should be taken when moving within hostile territory. Blindly bounding from one
position to the next without performing reconnaissance of the route to that next position, and any potential fields
of observation or fire, is a good way to be surprised by a missile or stream of tracers directed at your aircraft.


 Tree lines and terrain features can hide enemy
 units just as easily as it can your helicopter,
 potentially resulting in a lethal surprise




 Enemy units may be lurking around the next tree line

It is very possible that an attack helicopter aircrew can get themselves pinned down by hostile ground forces. If
the aircrew rushes from one terrain feature to the next without verifying the security of their next position or the
route to get there, the aircrew may be unable to go forward, they may be unable to go back, and if they climb
above the terrain, they may be engaged by air defenses. In this instance, the aircrew may need to risk the
success of their mission by expending significant quantities of munitions to fight their way out.

 to next battle position




 Scanning area around next battle
 position for possible enemy units




 Recon next battle position with alternative sources of cover

Weapons discipline is another practice that is important. Despite its firepower, an attack helicopter only has a
limited amount of munitions onboard to achieve the mission. These weapons should be used in a manner that
achieves the maximum effect on the battlefield whenever possible. Destroying every enemy that is detected while
enroute to the objective may feel satisfying, but running out of munitions prior to achieving the mission
objective(s) will remove that satisfaction quickly. Attack helicopters, by nature of their mobility and standoff, have
the advantage of being more selective about what engagements they choose to commit to, from where they may
engage their targets, and what targets they bypass and report to higher echelons.
Even when the primary objective is spotted, tactical patience should be exercised to fully develop the situation
and determine what else may be in the area. Prior to pulling the trigger, scanning the area for other enemy
positions nearby is important to ensure survival of the attack helicopter team. If the team has enough weapons
to spare, it may be wise to sanitize the immediate area of any threats (such as air defense units) prior to engaging
the primary targets.
Masking/Un-Masking and Terrain Flight
During armed conflicts in theaters which contain large numbers of air defenses, low-level tactics are the best
advantage that attack helicopters can employ. Although fixed-wing aircraft can use high speeds to minimize the
time spent inside the engagement zone of an air defense unit, helicopters must use terrain and other forms of
cover to limit their exposure to attain a reasonable level of survivability. The level of exposure and time spent
outside of cover and concealment should be primarily dependent on threat reaction time, but also may be
predicated on the time needed to perform sensor scans of an area or employ a weapon against a target. These
two factors – time needed by the enemy to detect/engage you versus time needed by you to detect/engage the
enemy – should constantly be weighed against the other throughout the mission as the tactical situation evolves.
When used in a conflict against armor supported by air defenses, attack helicopters such as the AH-64 are often
maneuvered akin to an infantryman or a sniper, rather than a conventional aircraft. When attack helicopters
utilize terrain and other forms of cover and concealment to remain hidden from enemy observation, this is known
as “masking”. When moving between battle positions near enemy units, attack helicopters bound from one battle
position to the next to minimize exposure to enemy fire (much in the same manner an infantryman bounds from
cover to cover) in an effort to remain undetected for as long as possible until they are ready to attack.
To perform sensor scans of the battlefield or engage enemy targets with their weapon systems, attack helicopters
must “un-mask” from behind cover. Depending on the nature of the cover/concealment, attack helicopters may
un-mask vertically or laterally to expose their sensors or weapon systems. When an attack is initiated, the enemy
should be engaged within the shortest amount of time possible before re-masking and relocating to a different
battle position. Weapons fire reveals the attack helicopter’s presence to the enemy, just as a sniper reveals his
position by firing on the enemy.


 Vertical “un-masking”

 Lateral “un-masking”




 Un-masking from behind cover

The most advantageous factor attack helicopters can use for their protection is terrain. Mother Earth will always
provide the best protection from enemy observation and weapons fire, just assuredly as it protects the
infantryman. However, low-altitude flight can be quite demanding on an aircrew, especially at night or in low-
visibility conditions. As such, the speed that helicopters can attain when operating at low altitudes is dependent
on the nature of the terrain, the tactical situation, the time of day, enemy air defenses, and how much power
margin is available to the aircrew.
Conversely, in a threat environment where air defenses are low and the most prevalent threat to helicopters is
small arms fire such as rifles or machine guns, it may be advantageous to maintain a higher altitude outside the
engagement ranges of such weapons. This will improve the range at which aircrews can detect the enemy, as
well as placing less demand on an aircrew when compared to flying at low altitude, allowing them to focus on
engaging the enemy.
AH-64 TACTICAL EMPLOYMENT
Pre-mission planning is the most important part of any successful combat mission. Just as in the case with other
military aircraft, factors such as terrain and threat locations should be considered when planning mission routes,
altitudes, and weapon loads. Routes and altitudes should be selected to maximize survivability and reduce the
probability of detection by threat weapon systems.
Routes, pre-planned targets, enemy threats, and other graphical control measures can be displayed on the AH-
64D’s Tactical Situation Display (TSD) along with information from the aircraft’s sensors to enhance situational
awareness and provide an overview of the surroundings. The TSD can further enhance situational awareness of
potential threat blind spots by using Color Bands (enabled from the TSD Map sub-page and TSD Threat Show
sub-page) and selecting an appropriate map type and scale. Configuring the SHOW options on the TSD is
important in ensuring critical information is present on the TSD for crews to reference during each phase of the
mission.
Upon departure from the airfield, assembly area, or FARP, or when approaching the Forward Edge of Battle Area
(FEBA), aircrews should conduct pre-combat checks and ensure the aircraft is ready to respond to enemy contact.
Accordingly, the AH-64D team should adjust their formation and flight patterns to those which are best suited for
the tactical situation, terrain, and airspeeds they intend to fly.


Team Maneuvering
The basic building block of any U.S. Army attack helicopter unit is an Air Weapons Team (AWT or simply “team”)
of two AH-64’s under the control of an Air Mission Commander (AMC), which is typically the most experienced
Pilot-in-Command (PC) within the flight. The AMC is responsible for ensuring the success of the team’s mission
and is the overall weapons release authority for the team.
Maneuverability is the primary consideration for the AWT. The lead aircraft (“Lead”) should strive to maneuver
in a predictable manner for the wingman (“Wing” or “Trail”); and the wingman should strive to position their
aircraft in such a way to never inhibit the lead aircraft’s ability to maneuver while always being ready to provide
suppressive fire in support of Lead, if needed. Distance between aircraft can vary based on terrain, proximity to
the ground, illumination/visibility, and expected or known enemy threats; but distances may range from 3 to 5
rotor discs to a kilometer or more. Distances are typically greater when over open terrain, whereas distances
between aircraft will be less when operating in restrictive terrain.

 Formation Distances
Combat Cruise is the standard formation for AWT employment. It is preferable at very low altitudes and provides
the most flexibility of the flight while reducing predictability. Combat Cruise provides an area to the rear of the
lead aircraft, along their aft hemisphere, for wingmen to maneuver. The trail aircraft positions their aircraft in
such a way to provide fire support for the lead aircraft if unexpected enemy units are encountered. Combat Cruise
Left/Right “pins” the wingmen to one side of the lead aircraft during situations in which maneuvers to the
opposite side are not feasible, possibly due to terrain.

 Combat Cruise

Combat Spread maximizes forward firepower with overlapping sensor fields-of-view and weapons fields-of-fire,
at the expense of ease of maneuverability and team flexibility. The trail aircraft sets their position abeam of the
lead aircraft at the 3 o’clock or 9 o’clock positions. Combat Spread requires a high degree of scanning and
coordination between the Pilot’s in each aircraft, particularly at night due to the field-of-view limitations of Night
Vision Systems (NVS). Distance between aircraft should be based on maneuver room, visibility, terrain, and
expected enemy contact.

Terrain Flight Modes
The purpose of terrain flight and the associated modes of terrain flight is to deny or delay enemy forces the ability
to detect, track, and engage the aircraft. Terrain flight requires constant visual scanning to see and avoid
obstacles, particularly at night. The most important rule when conducting terrain flight is to never “out-fly” the
capabilities of the sensor being used for flight, nor the capabilities of the aircrew to respond to low-level hazards.
If weather and ambient lighting conditions restrict or reduce visibility, the aircrew should decrease their airspeed.
Continuous operations in a single terrain flight mode is typically unlikely, as terrain and vegetation will vary
throughout the Area of Operations (AO). Crews can expect to transition into and out of each mode as a natural
part of performing terrain flight operations. The modes of terrain flight are defined below:

• Low-level. Low-level flight is conducted at a constant altitude and airspeed, typically between 80 to 200
 feet above the highest obstacle (AHO). Under these conditions, it will most likely be advantageous to use a
 “Traveling” movement technique (constant altitude and airspeed) to rapidly transit from one place to
 another, however this method provides the least amount of security for unexpected enemy encounters.

• Contour. Contour flight is conducted at low altitude conforming to the contours of the earth, typically
 between 25 to 80 feet AHO. It is characterized by varying airspeeds and altitude, which will be dictated by
 the terrain itself and obstacles. Under these conditions, it will most likely be advantageous to use a “Traveling
 Overwatch” movement technique (varying altitudes and airspeeds) and utilize Combat Cruise as the
 formation pattern in which the trail aircraft is positioned to respond to enemy contact.

• Nap-Of-the-Earth (NOE). NOE flight is conducted at low airspeeds and altitudes as close to the earth’s
 surface as vegetation and obstacles permit, usually between the surface and 25 feet AHO. Under these
 conditions, it will most likely be advantageous to use a “Bounding Overwatch” movement technique, where
 one aircraft maintains position and provides cover while the other aircraft moves to the next position. Care
 should be taken to avoid bounding beyond the range of the weapon systems of the aircraft providing cover.

 Low-level: 80-200 feet AHO




 Contour: 25-80 feet AHO




 Nap-Of-the Earth: <25 feet AHO



 Terrain Flight Modes
Weapon Delivery Techniques
The three techniques for weapons delivery from an attack helicopter are defined below:

• Hover Fire. Hover fire is typically conducted at speeds less than effective translational lift (ETL, roughly 16-
 24 knots airspeed) and may be conducted from a stationary hover or a hover with movement; such as
 laterally un-masking.

• Running Fire. Running fire is typically conducted at speeds greater than ETL. Forward airspeed adds
 stability to the helicopter and increases the accuracy of unguided weapon systems, particularly rockets.

• Diving Fire. Diving fire is an engagement conducted in a diving profile, typically between -10° to -30° pitch
 attitudes. Airspeed and altitude will be determined by the expected threat level from enemy defenses and
 desired weapons effects, with a steeper dive providing a smaller “beaten zone” and improved accuracy.
 However, a steep dive will also require more altitude for recovery. Diving fire may be performed following a
 climb from low altitudes (a “bump” from behind cover), or from level flight at high altitudes.

SIGHTS AND SENSORS
The AH-64D uses a wide range of sensors to detect, acquire, and engage targets on the battlefield. These sensors
range from the basic “Mark 1 eyeball” to an advanced fire control radar, and each sensor is integrated into the
aircraft’s Data Management System to enhance situational awareness and facilitate rapid engagement of enemy
forces during day or night.

 AH-64D Sights and Sensors

Although the AH-64D is equipped with a multitude of sensors for various purposes (such as the radar altimeter
or Doppler radar velocity sensor that aid in flight operations and navigation), sensors such as the optical cameras
in the nose turret or the mast-mounted fire control radar perform targeting against enemy locations and
equipment. These sensors are grouped within specific sensor arrays called “sights”, which generate targeting
solutions for employment of aircraft weapon systems.
Four sights are available to the AH-64D crew, but only one sight may be used within a crewstation at any given
time. These sights are the Pilot’s Helmet-Mounted Display (HMD), the Copilot’s HMD, the Target Acquisition
Designation Sight (TADS), and the Fire Control Radar (FCR). Each of these sights includes multiple sensors that
may be used individually or cooperatively to employ the weapon system selected by the crewmember; and each
has its own advantages and disadvantages when deciding how and when to engage the enemy.
Each sight and its corresponding sensors are shown below.

* Night vision goggles may aid either crewmember in detecting weapons fire or IR pointers on the battlefield,
but they are not intended to be used for direct targeting when using HMD as a sight. They may be used to direct
the TADS to an area for subsequent targeting or observation. (See Night Vision Goggles for more information.)
Helmet-Mounted Display (HMD)
The HMD may be used to rapidly direct weapons toward enemy locations at close range. When selected as the
crewmember’s sight, weapon solutions are generated for the crewmember’s actioned weapon based on the
crewmember’s helmet position and their current range source.
NVS mode may be used in conjunction with the HMD to augment the crew’s ability to engage targets at night.
(See the Helmet-Mounted Display chapter for more information.)


Target Acquisition Designation Sight (TADS)
The TADS uses a combination of electro-optical sensors in the visible and infrared spectrums to detect and target
enemy forces at long range or perform reconnaissance, during day or night. When selected as the
Copilot/Gunner’s sight, weapon solutions are generated for the CPG’s actioned weapon based on the TADS turret
position and the CPG’s current range source.
(See the Target Acquisition Designation Sight chapter for more information.)


Fire Control Radar (FCR)
The FCR mast-mounted assembly consists of an active radar antenna to rapidly scan large areas of the battlefield
(or the airspace above it) and a passive radar detection antenna array to target radar-emitting air defense
systems. When selected as the crewmember’s sight, weapon solutions are generated for the crewmember’s
actioned weapon based on the location of the Next-To-Shoot (NTS) target on the FCR page.
(See the Fire Control Radar chapter for more information)


Sight Selection Logic
Sight selection logic is outlined below.
• Both crewmembers may select their respective HMD as their sight at any time since each crewmember’s
 helmet position is tracked independently of the other; but they cannot select the opposite crewmember’s
 HMD as their sight.
• Only the CPG may select TADS as a sight, however either crewmember may utilize TADS as their selected
 NVS sensor. (See Night Vision System for more information.)
• Either crewmember may select FCR as their sight, however only one crewmember may do so at any given
 time. If the CPG’s selected sight is FCR and the Pilot selects FCR, the CPG’s sight will automatically be set
 to HMD and any actioned weapon in the CPG crewstation will be de-actioned. If the Pilot’s selected sight is
 FCR and the CPG selects FCR, the Pilot’s sight will automatically be set to HMD and any actioned weapon in
 the Pilot crewstation will be de-actioned.
• The TADS may be linked to the FCR Next-To-Shoot (NTS) target. If the Pilot’s selected sight is FCR and the
 CPG’s selected sight is TADS, when the Pilot links the TADS to the FCR the CPG’s sight will automatically be
 set to HMD and any actioned weapon in the CPG crewstation will be de-actioned.
• The FCR may be linked to the TADS line-of-sight. If the CPG’s selected sight is TADS and the Pilot’s selected
 sight is FCR, when the CPG links the FCR to the TADS the Pilot’s sight will automatically be set to HMD, and
 any actioned weapon in the Pilot crewstation will be de-actioned.
ACQUISITION (ACQ) SOURCES
Acquisition sources increase aircrew efficiency in orienting their sights to locations on the battlefield, whether it
be to slave a sight to a target detected or tracked by another sensor onboard the aircraft (to include visual
detection by either crewmember), or to slave their sight to a set of three-dimensional coordinates. The purpose
of the acquisition source is to automate or reduce the need to manually search and acquire a target with the
selected sight; acquisition sources do not directly affect the weapon aiming solution for any weapon system.

 Acquisition sources on the battlefield

In the case of the TADS or FCR, these sights will physically slew to the location of the acquisition source selected
within the crewstation. In the case of the HMD, the crewmember will receive cueing indications within their
helmet symbology of which direction they must direct their head to acquire the selected acquisition source (in
lieu of a robotic arm physically grabbing their head and forcibly turning it in the correct direction). As several
examples, the Copilot/Gunner (CPG) could select the Pilot’s helmet as the acquisition source to slave the TADS
turret to a target that the Pilot is looking at, the Pilot could select TADS as the acquisition source to monitor the
direction the CPG is aiming the TADS, or either crewmember could select a target point stored within the database
to slave their sight to that 3-dimensional location.
Each crewmember may select an acquisition (ACQ) source from the following list:
• PHS – Pilot Helmet Sight • FXD – Fixed forward (0° in azimuth/-4.9° elevation)
• GHS – Gunner Helmet Sight • TADS – Target Acquisition Designation Sight
• SKR – Tracking missile seeker • W##, H##, C##, T## – Waypoint, Hazard, Control
• RFI – Radar Frequency Interferometer Measure, or Target/Threat
• FCR – Fire Control Radar • TRN – Cursor-selected terrain location on the TSD

As is the case with sight selections, choosing the best acquisition source in any given situation is key to reducing
the time needed to search, acquire, and engage enemy targets. In most circumstances, the most important
factors in choosing the correct acquisition source are proper coordination and communication between
crewmembers; so that each crewmember is aware of how the other is using their selected sight, and whether a
target should be handed off from one crewmember to the other for engagement by the appropriate sight/weapon
combination.
ACQ Selection Logic
In most cases, any of the available sights (HMD, TADS, or FCR) may serve as an acquisition source for another
sight. However, a crewmember cannot select an acquisition source that is already selected as the sight within
the same crewstation. For example, the CPG cannot simultaneously select TADS as a sight and an acquisition
source, because the TADS cannot be slaved to itself (the TADS is already looking where it is currently looking).
As such, some acquisition sources will be contextually removed from the acquisition selection menu if already
selected as the crewmember’s sight (e.g., “TADS” will be removed from the CPG’s acquisition selection menu if
the CPG has selected TADS as a sight).
• If the Pilot’s selected sight is HMD, PHS will be removed from the Pilot’s ACQ selection menu.
• If the Pilot’s selected sight is FCR, FCR will be removed from the Pilot’s ACQ selection menu.
• If the CPG’s selected sight is HMD, GHS will be removed from the CPG’s ACQ selection menu.
• If the CPG’s selected sight is TADS, TADS will be removed from the CPG’s ACQ selection menu.
• If the CPG’s selected sight is FCR, FCR will be removed from the CPG’s ACQ selection menu.
• If the FCR mast-mounted assembly is not installed, FCR and RFI will not be available within either
 crewmember’s ACQ selection menu.
• If the TADS is being used as an NVS sensor, TADS will be removed from the ACQ selection menu within the
 same crewstation in which it is being used. (See Night Vision System for more information.)
Acquisition sources may be selected from the WPN, TSD, or FCR pages by opening the ACQ selection menu (VAB
R6). Acquisition sources that are available for selection will be displayed, with the current ACQ selection boxed.




 Acquisition (ACQ) Selection Menu

In many instances, an acquisition source may be available for selection, but the acquisition may be invalid and
cannot provide cueing to a crewmember’s sight. When this occurs, the acquisition source will be displayed in
white and annotated with a “?”. As an example, if a crewmember has not created a Terrain point on their TSD,
“?TRN” will be displayed within the ACQ selection menu but will be invalid until the crewmember creates a Terrain
point.
ACQ Slave Logic
Once an acquisition source is selected within the CPG crewstation, the CPG’s sight must be “slaved” to it. The
CPG may selectively enable (“slaved”) or disable (“de-slaved”) the Slave function using the SLAVE button located
on the TEDAC Right Handgrip.
• If the CPG selects a different sight, SLAVE is automatically disabled.
• If the CPG selects a different acquisition source, SLAVE is automatically disabled.
The Pilot does not have an option to selectively enable/disable the Slave function. The Pilot’s sight is always
“slaved” to the Pilot’s acquisition source.
• If the Pilot’s selected sight is FCR, the FCR will be slaved to the Pilot’s ACQ at all times.
• The Pilot may selectively remove ACQ cueing from the HMD Flight symbology. (See WPN Utility sub-page
 for more information.)
In the case of setting the acquisition source to a point within the database (Waypoint, Hazard, Control Measure,
or Target/Threat) or to a cursor-selected terrain location on the TSD (Terrain point), this action will also set that
crewmember’s range source to a Navigation range when SLAVE is subsequently enabled.
• If the CPG’s acquisition source is set to a Waypoint, Hazard, Control Measure, Target/Threat, or Terrain
 point, the slant range to that point will be entered as a Navigation range when the SLAVE button is pressed
 on the TEDAC Right Handgrip.
• If the Pilot’s acquisition source is set to a Waypoint, Hazard, Control Measure, Target/Threat, or Terrain
 point, the slant range to that point will be entered as a Navigation range immediately upon selection from
 the ACQ selection menu.
Typically, during training flights outside of a combat area, each crewmember selects the opposite crewmember’s
helmet (GHS/PHS) as their acquisition source to facilitate traffic and obstacle advisories.
During combat, it may be useful for the CPG to be slaved to GHS to remain “heads out” while searching for
targets, and then de-slaving when a target or point of interest is acquired. The Pilot may often use TADS as the
acquisition source to maintain situational awareness of where the TADS is oriented. This is particularly useful for
the Pilot since it provides the Cued LOS Dot within the HMD Field-Of-Regard (FOR), which assists the Pilot in
monitoring the position of the TADS turret so that he or she may maneuver the aircraft to avoid the turret slew
limits.
NIGHT VISION GOGGLES (NVG)
The AN/AVS-6 Aviator Night Vision Imaging System (ANVIS) provides aircrews with a high-fidelity, binocular, 40°
field-of-view under extreme low-light conditions. The AVS-6 NVG’s amplify light in the visible and near-infrared
spectrum to enable aircrews to operate at NOE altitudes near terrain and other natural or man-made obstacles,
under all but the darkest, moonless nights.




The HDU physically interferes with the proper wear of NVG’s (and can incur misalignments within the HDU
symbology when viewed through the NVG’s) and may not be used simultaneously. If the NVG’s are enabled, the
HDU will be rotated away from the crewmember’s face prior to the NVG’s being lowered into view. The IHADSS
will continue to track the helmet position and aircraft sensors may be cued to the crewmember’s approximate
line-of-sight, but NVG’s should not be used as a means of targeting due to the lack of precise aiming symbology.
HELMET-MOUNTED
DISPLAY (HMD)




 HELMET-MOUNTED
 DISPLAY (HMD)
HELMET-MOUNTED DISPLAY (HMD)
The Helmet-Mounted Display is part of the Integrated Helmet And Display Sighting System (IHADSS) which allows
either crewmember to employ aircraft weapons, cue other aircraft sensors to specific locations, or even direct
the opposite crewmember to locations seen outside the cockpit.




Unlike many helmet cueing systems that were post-production modifications to fixed-wing combat aircraft, the
AH-64’s helmet sight was designed from the beginning to function as both the primary display for flight
information and as an independent but integrated targeting system.
The overall IHADSS consists of several subcomponents that must be defined.
• IHU. Integrated Helmet Unit; the
 crewmember’s flight helmet with integrated
 helmet position tracking sensors.
• HDU. Helmet Display Unit; the physical
 device that is clipped to the crewmember’s
 IHU that projects symbology and video onto
 a combiner lens in front of the right eye.
• HMD. Helmet-Mounted Display; the method
 of sighting through aiming symbology
 projected onto the HDU combiner lens for
 generating weapon solutions.
• IHADSS. Integrated Helmet And Display
 Sighting System; the entire system that
 tracks the position of each crewmember’s
 IHU, generates symbology for display on the
 HDU, and processes weapon solutions based
 on sighting through the HMD. HMD Sighting
HMD Activation
Both crewmembers’ individual Helmet Display Units (HDU)
receive symbology and video data from the aircraft Display
Processors (DP); however the CPG’s HDU also requires the
TADS to be powered in order to function. As such, the HDU’s
in each cockpit are automatically initialized when the APU is
powered on. If the TADS is powered off from the CPG’s WPN
Utility sub-page (shown at right), or from either crewstation
on the DMS Shutdown sub-page, the CPG’s HDU will blank
completely.
The IHADSS can be selectively powered on or off from either
crewstation by pressing VAB L1 on the WPN Utility sub-page,
but disabling this system will affect the HDU’s in both
crewstations. When the IHADSS is disabled, helmet-tracking
in both crewstations is disabled and symbology displayed
within the HDU’s will be lost, although sensor video may still
be present.




Integrated Helmet Unit (IHU) & Helmet Display Unit (HDU)
The Integrated Helmet Unit uses a
combination of infrared tracking sensors
integrated into the helmet itself and Sensor Integrated Helmet Unit (IHU)
Surveying Units (SSU) mounted within the
crewstation to determine the helmet
 IHU tracking sensors
position in azimuth and elevation. (both sides)

The helmet position is processed by the
aircraft electronics, which updates
 HDU Combiner Lens
symbology projected into the Helmet
Display Unit in real-time. If the
crewmember’s selected sight is HMD, the Helmet Display Unit (HDU)
aircraft electronics calculates weapon
solutions for the crewmember’s current
weapon based on the selected range
source along the HMD line-of-sight.
During initialization of aircraft systems prior
to takeoff, each crewmember performs a
boresight of their IHU after mounting the
HDU to their helmet.
(See IHADSS Boresight on the following page for more information.)
IHADSS Boresight
During aircraft start-up, the helmet within each crewstation must be boresighted to provide the IHADSS with
accurate azimuth and elevation position data of each crewmember’s helmet. Until a successful boresight has been
performed, the Sight Status field of the High Action Display will alternate between displaying “IHADSS” and “B/S
REQUIRED” status messages, and the Cueing Dots will flash around the HMD LOS Reticle. (See HMD High Action
Display for more information.)
The IHADSS boresight procedure is performed by accessing the BORESIGHT sub-page by pressing VAB L5 on the
WPN page. After entering the BORESIGHT sub-page, the crewmember selects IHADSS (VAB L4) to enable the
IHADSS boresight logic and activate the Boresight Reticle Unit (BRU) mounted on top of the instrument panel
(below, left). When IHADSS is pressed and the text is boxed, B/S NOW is displayed at VAB L6 and the MPD cursor
is automatically positioned over the option (below, right).

 3. B/S NOW (VAB L6)




If desired, REMOVE MESSAGE (VAB R3) may be pressed to remove the “IHADSS B/S REQUIRED” message from
the Sight Status field of the High Action Display.
When the IHADSS boresight logic is enabled, a bullseye pattern is displayed within the BRU, the brightness of
which is controlled by the PRIMARY lighting knob on the EXTLT/INTR LT panel on the Pilot’s Left Console, or the
INTR LT panel on the CPG’s Left Console.




 Pilot (Left) and CPG (Right) PRIMARY lighting knobs
After the BRU has been activated and is adjusted to the appropriate brightness, the position and orientation of
the helmet should be adjusted so that the bullseye pattern is centered within the BRU and the LOS Reticle is
aligned with the center of the bullseye, as shown below. If necessary, Transition or Cruise symbology modes
should be selected to ensure the Horizon Line is level with the cockpit frame.

 B/S NOW (VAB L6) is pressed

When the HMD LOS Reticle and the BRU bullseye pattern are properly aligned, the B/S NOW is commanded by
pressing VAB L6 or by using the MPD Cursor-Enter option on the Collective Mission Grip (or the TEDAC Left
Handgrip in the CPG crewstation). If the boresight position is accepted, the bullseye pattern within the BRU will
extinguish, the B/S NOW option (VAB L6) will be removed, and IHADSS (VAB L4) on the BORESIGHT sub-page
will be un-boxed.
The IHADSS boresight process may be aborted at any time by re-selecting IHADSS (VAB L4), which will remove
the B/S NOW option and extinguish the bullseye pattern within the BRU.
HMD HIGH ACTION DISPLAY
If the crewmember’s selected sight is HMD, Flight symbology is displayed on the crewmember’s HDU; and
specifically in the case of the Copilot/Gunner (CPG), HMD Weapon symbology is displayed on the CPG’s TDU.
The pertinent targeting- and weapon-related symbology when using HMD as the selected sight is the Line-Of-
Sight (LOS) Reticle, LOS Reticle Cueing Dots, and the High Action Display (HAD) data fields shown below.

1. Line-Of-Sight Reticle. Indicates the HMD line-of-sight (LOS). When the crewmember’s selected sight is
 HMD, the LOS Reticle is used as an aiming crosshair for weapons employment and laser designation.
 The LOS Reticle flashes when the selected sight’s LOS is invalid or has reached its slew limit.
2. Cueing Dots. Indicates the quadrant direction of the selected acquisition source to “cue” the crewmember’s
 helmet position to the location of the Cued LOS Reticle. The dots are removed when the Cued LOS Reticle
 is with 4° of that quadrant relative to the LOS Reticle.
 All four dots flash when the “IHADSS B/S REQUIRED” message is present within the Sight Status field of the
 High Action Display, indicating the crewmember needs to boresight their IHADSS.
3. Weapon Inhibit Status. Displays any pertinent safety or performance inhibits that may affect weapons
 employment, based on the currently actioned weapon within the crewstation. (See the Weapon Employment
 chapter for more information.)
4. Range Source/Range. Displays the range source in use and the current range in tenths of kilometers, or
 meters if the range source is the LRFD.
 • Default range. Default range is selected upon initial aircraft power-on, or any time the crewmember’s
 current range source is no longer valid. The Default range for the Pilot is 1.5 km, and 3.0 km for the
 CPG (displayed as “1.5” and “3.0” respectively).
 • Manual range. Manual range may be selected and modified on the WPN page and may be set in 1-

 to NORM mode.
HMD ACQUISITION AND RANGING
Detecting, acquiring, and engaging targets with the HMD is fairly straightforward, in that the HMD simply needs
to be pointed toward the target to generate an appropriate weapon solution. Unlike the TADS, the HMD does not
include additional targeting modes to assist the crewmember in stabilizing their HMD line-of-sight onto a target
position. As such, when using HMD as the selected sight, the aircraft electronics do not provide the same levels
of ballistic compensation as compared to using the TADS. Ballistic compensation for aircraft movement or lead
angle compensation for target movement is not provided; however ballistic compensation for range is provided,
subject to the crewmember’s selected range source.
When operating at night, using Night Vision
System (NVS) in NORM mode allows either
crewmember to utilize their respective FLIR
system to detect and acquire targets, even those
that may otherwise be obscured by the cockpit PNVS
structure or canopy frames. However, it is Field-Of-Regard
important to understand each sensor (PNVS and
TADS) is subject to different slew values.
(See Night Vision System for more information.)
The format of the Field-Of-Regard (FOR) Box
displayed within the HMD High Action Display is TADS TADS
indicative of not only the slew limitations of the Field-Of-Regard Field-Of-Regard
currently assigned NVS sensor, but which sensor
is assigned to the crewstation. If the LOS Reticle
has exceeded the slew limitations of the NVS
sensor currently assigned to the crewstation,
even if the NVS mode is set to OFF, the HMD LOS
Reticle will flash and “LIMITS” will be displayed
within the Sight Status field of the High Action
Display.




Acquisition Sources
The use of acquisition sources can reduce the time necessary to bring the HMD onto an intended target. When
a target is detected using another sensor onboard the aircraft (to include visual detection by either crewmember),
setting that sensor as the acquisition source and enabling the SLAVE function increases the efficiency of target
acquisition within the HMD field-of-view.
However, since the HMD line-of-sight is solely directed by the crewmember’s helmet position, “cueing” indications
are displayed within the HMD symbology. When a valid acquisition source is selected, cueing dots will appear
around the HMD LOS Reticle to cue the crewmember’s head position to the corresponding direction of where the
acquisition source is located.
HMD cueing is enabled within a crewstation any time the HMD is the selected sight and SLAVE is enabled. Within
the CPG crewstation, SLAVE is toggled from the TEDAC Right Handgrip. However, since the Pilot crewstation does
not have an option to selectively enable SLAVE, SLAVE is permanently enabled for the Pilot. The Pilot does have
an option to disable the display of cueing dots within the HMD symbology from the WPN Utility sub-page.
Acquisition sources also reduce the amount of verbal communications and coordination of sensors that must
occur between the crewmembers, which also increases combat efficiency. By replacing the verbal description of
a target (or threat) using a verbose “description, direction, distance” with a concise “sight to source” command,
target handovers between crewstations may become near instantaneous with a proficient aircrew. In addition,
cueing the opposite crewmember’s helmet line-of-sight directly to the location of the acquisition source reduces
the effects of inaccurate range estimations and removes the need for verbal descriptions of the intended target,
obstacles or hazards to flight, or visual reference points.
An example of an inefficient obstacle handover during flight operations at night is shown below:
“Tower obstacle at 11 o’clock, approximately 2 kilometers, on our flight route along the right side of the valley.”
The Pilot must look toward the approximate direction, visually trace their projected flight path along the right
side of the valley and then locate the obstacle amongst any background clutter seen within the NVS FLIR video.
Examples of efficient handovers of obstacles or hazards utilizing HMD cueing to an acquisition source (such as
the opposite crewmember’s helmet sight) are shown below:
“Tower obstacle in 2 kilometers, my line-of-sight.”
“Aircraft, my line-of-sight, on the horizon, come right to avoid.”
In either case, the crewmember simply follows the cueing within their HMD symbology until the Cued LOS Reticle
becomes visible, at which point they can see the precise location that is being referenced by the other
crewmember’s helmet sight, removing most of any ambiguity that exists.
Acquisition sources that will cue the HMD to a specific azimuth and elevation relative to the aircraft nose are
listed below.
• PHS. Pilot Helmet Sight; cues the HMD to the line-of-sight of the Pilot’s helmet. May be used to direct the
 CPG’s HMD line-of-sight to the location designated by the Pilot’s HMD LOS Reticle.
• GHS. Gunner Helmet Sight; cues the HMD to the line-of-sight of the Copilot/Gunner’s helmet. May be used
 to direct the Pilot’s HMD line-of-sight to the location designated by the CPG’s HMD LOS Reticle.
• SKR. Seeker; cues the HMD to the line-of-sight of the next-to-shoot AGM-114 missile seeker. May be used
 to direct the crewmember’s HMD line-of-sight to the target location that is currently being tracked by the
 next-to-shoot AGM-114 missile, possibly to confirm target identification prior to weapons release.
• FXD. Fixed forward; cues the HMD to align with the Armament Datum Line (ADL) at 0° in azimuth and -
 4.9° in elevation.
• TADS. Target Acquisition Designation Sight; cues the HMD to the line-of-sight of the TADS turret. May be
 used to monitor the TADS sensor position for situational awareness or coordinating weapon engagements.
Acquisition sources that will cue the HMD to a 3-dimensional location relative to the ownship position are listed
below.
• FCR. Fire Control Radar; cues the HMD to the location of the next-to-shoot target designated on the FCR
 page. May be used to direct the crewmember’s HMD line-of-sight to the location of the designated target
 for situational awareness or to engage the designated target while using HMD as the sight.
• W##, H##, C##, T##. Waypoint, Hazard, Control Measure, or Target/Threat point; cues the HMD to
 the coordinates of the selected point within the navigation database. May be used to direct the
 crewmember’s HMD line-of-sight to a pre-planned, stored, or transmitted location for reconnaissance, visual
 identification, weapons engagement, or re-acquisition if line-of-sight was lost.
• TRN. Terrain point; cues the HMD to the coordinates of the selected terrain point within the navigation
 database. May be used to direct the crewmember’s HMD line-of-sight to a cursor-selected location on the
 TSD that is not associated with an existing Waypoint, Hazard, Control Measure, or Target/Threat point for
 reconnaissance, visual identification, or weapons engagement.
Range Sources
Once a target has been visually acquired by the crewmember, the next and perhaps most critical step in ensuring
a successful weapon engagement is determining an appropriate range source for the engagement. As the HMD
line-of-sight can only determine a target’s relative azimuth and elevation with respect to the aircraft’s attitude,
measuring the range to the target along the HMD line-of-sight provides the third dimension needed to determine
the target’s 3-dimensional position relative to the ownship.
Among the three sights (HMD, TADS, and FCR) that may be employed by the AH-64D aircrew for targeting, the
HMD is roughly comparable to the TADS with regards to the available methods of ranging that may be employed.
When a method of ranging is employed, this is called a “range source”, and is displayed within the High Action
Display in both Flight Symbology and Weapon Symbology.
The range sources that are available to either crewmember when using the HMD as the selected sight are shown
below, from the most accurate to the least accurate.
• Laser range (COOP mode). Laser range is automatically entered as the range source any time the CPG
 fires the TADS LRFD to measure the slant range between the ownship and the target using reflected laser
 energy. Laser range is only displayed in the Pilot’s HMD when employing rockets in a Cooperative mode.
• Navigation range. Navigation range is automatically entered as the range source any time the HMD is
 cued to a Waypoint, Hazard, Control Measure, Target/Threat, or a Terrain point. The slant range between
 the ownship and the corresponding point’s navigational coordinates are calculated and is subject to the
 position confidence of the aircraft.
• Automatic range. Automatic range is selected from the WPN page by pressing MANRNG> (VAB B6) and
 entering “A” on the Keyboard Unit (KU) in place of a numerical value. Auto-range is determined by the radar
 altitude of the aircraft over the ground and the elevation “look-down” angle of the HMD line-of-sight.
• Manual range. Manual range is selected from the WPN page by pressing MANRNG> (VAB B6) and entering
 a numeric value on the Keyboard Unit.
• Default range. Default range is selected upon initial aircraft power-on, or any time the crewmember’s
 current range source is no longer valid.
NOTE: When transitioning from using the TADS as the selected sight to using the HMD, it is possible for the
Copilot/Gunner (CPG) to retain a static laser range as the range source. When the gun is actioned while the HMD
is the selected sight, the range source will automatically revert to the Manual range within the crewstation.
However, if intending to employ rockets using the HMD, a different range source should be considered that is
appropriate for the given situation.
When determining which range source to utilize when the HMD is the selected sight, the common deciding factor
will be whether the engagement is “deliberate” or “hasty” in nature. When conducting a deliberate engagement,
the crew will typically have time to reliably calculate and/or store the target location, determine a reasonably
accurate range from the intended weapon release point to the target, and employ a weapon system while the
target is directly in front of the aircraft in optimal release parameters. In such situations, a dynamic range source
such as a Navigation range to the target location or (when employing unguided rockets) Cooperative TADS laser
ranging will provide a more accurate targeting solution. Automatic range is another dynamic range source that
may be used but may not always be appropriate depending on the terrain the aircraft is operating over, or the
resulting oscillations in calculated range caused by rapid head and/or aircraft movements.
In many situations in which a crewmember is using the HMD as the selected sight to engage a close-range target
in a hasty manner, a static range source such as Manual range is typically more appropriate since it allows the
crewmember to rapidly adjust rounds onto the target without needing to change the acquisition source to employ
a Nav range; nor is it subject to the errors with Auto-ranging when operating over un-even terrain or when the
crewmember is rapidly moving his/her head. A Manual range is not dynamic and represents a fixed point in space
to which weapon solutions are calculated. As such, the HMD elevation relative to the target will need to be
manually adjusted to account for rounds that impact prior to or beyond the target (also referred to as landing
“short” or “long”).
Navigation Range
Navigation range is calculated by simply measuring the slant range between the ownship position and the
coordinates of a point stored within the navigational database. Although a Nav range is more accurate than using
Auto-ranging or Man-ranging, in that it is dynamically updated with aircraft movement and does not rely on flat
terrain as is the case with Automatic range, Nav range may be somewhat inflexible when using the HMD as the
selected sight for targeting.
Any time the acquisition source is set to a Waypoint, Hazard, Control Measure, Target/Threat, or Terrain point,
the slant range to the corresponding point is entered as a Nav range (the SLAVE button must be pressed to
update the HMD range source to a Nav range in the CPG crewstation). When employing weapons while using the
HMD as the selected sight, a Navigation range is only preferred if the intended target is within close proximity to
the coordinates of the point being referenced by the Nav range, or if employing area effect weapons against the
general area surrounding the point.
In the figure below, the intended target is at a range to the ownship that is substantially closer than the point
being referenced (T01) for the Nav range. In such a situation, rockets would impact beyond the target due to
the equivalent slant range being applied along the HMD line-of-sight, placing the weapon solution beyond the
target and below the surface plane. The HMD LOS Reticle would need to be displaced below the target within
the HMD field-of-view to adjust the weapon solution in such a manner so that the weapon trajectory would
intersect with the target location.

 Navigation Range (ACQ set to T01)

The most common use cases for employing a Nav range are when the Pilot is employing unguided rockets with
variable time delay fuzes independently of the CPG. Rocket types such as the M255A1 or M261 are dependent
on an accurate range to target for their warheads to be effective. Unless fired in Cooperative mode with the CPG’s
TADS supplying an accurate laser range, the most accurate range source that can be used by the Pilot to achieve
the desired warhead effects is a Nav range.
Automatic Range
Automatic range is calculated using trigonometric ratios of right triangles, where the HMD look-down angle
relative to the vertical axis between the aircraft and the surface below it is the acute angle; and the altitude
above ground level (as measured by the radar altimeter) is the adjacent edge of the right triangle.
Using these two variables, along with an assumption the target is at an elevation equal to the that of the surface
directly below the aircraft along a lateral axis that represents the opposite edge of the right triangle, the
hypotenuse is calculated to determine the slant range to target. This calculation is performed continuously based
on the HMD line-of-sight elevation and the radar altitude of the aircraft.

 Automatic Range (flat terrain)

As the HMD line-of-sight (LOS) approaches the horizon and the look-down angles become quite shallow, the
Auto-range calculations will become increasingly less precise due to the trigonometric ratios becoming quite large
which is exacerbated if the aircraft is operating at very low altitudes over the surface.

Automatic range relies upon a functioning radar altimeter and will only be usable when the aircraft’s altitude
above ground level (AGL) is less than 1,428 feet (the maximum altitude that is capable of being measured by the
radar altimeter).
It is important to note that the accuracy of Automatic range is predicated on the assumption that the target is at
the same elevation as the surface directly below the aircraft. As this may not always be the case, using Auto-
range for weapon engagements should only be performed in areas with minimal terrain relief, such as open
plains, non-mountainous deserts, large plateaus, or basins. Auto-range should not be used when operating over
mountains, rolling hills, or complex urban areas.

In situations where the terrain directly below the aircraft is at a significantly higher elevation than that of the
intended target, it should be expected that any weapon solution generated using Auto-range will result in
unguided, ballistic munitions such as rockets or gun rounds landing short of the target location. Likewise, in
situations where the terrain directly below the aircraft is at a significantly lower elevation than that of the intended
target, it should be expected that rockets or gun rounds will land long beyond the target location.
Manual/Default Range
Manual range is the most inaccurate form of ranging when using the HMD. However, it is the most flexible ranging
option when needing to engage targets in a hasty manner, and as a result is typically the preferred range source.
When a manual range value is entered, the weapon solution will continue to update based on the HMD line-of-
sight (LOS), but the range value will be to a fixed point in space along the LOS at the range entered on the WPN
page.

 Manual/Default Range

A Man-range is analogous to zeroing a rifle at a specific distance, and manually compensating for bullet drop by
manually elevating the weapon sight higher or lower depending on the estimated range to the target relative to
the range to which the rifle was zeroed.
• If the intended target is estimated to be at a range greater than the manual range value, the HMD LOS
 Reticle must be aimed above the target to compensate for the additional bullet (or rocket) drop.
• If the intended target is estimated to be at a range less than the manual range value, the HMD LOS Reticle
 must be aimed below the target to compensate for the reduced bullet (or rocket) drop.

(TADS)




 TARGET ACQUISITION
DESIGNATION SIGHT (TADS)
AN/ASQ-170 MODERNIZED TARGET
ACQUISITION DESIGNATION SIGHT
The AN/ASQ-170 TADS was originally designed by Martin Marietta and was selected to provide the primary
sighting and sensor system for the AH-64A, and remained in use by the AH-64D during the early years of its
service. The subsequent upgrade to the M-TADS standard by Lockheed Martin includes targeting enhancements
that increase the range and resolution that the AH-64D can detect and engage targets.




The Direct View Optics (DVO) sensor was subsequently removed during later development of the AH-64D,
although the corresponding aperture within the sensor turret itself remains.


TADS Activation
The TADS is automatically initialized when the APU is
powered on. If necessary, the TADS can be selectively
powered on or off from the CPG station by pressing VAB L4
on the WPN Utility sub-page (shown at right), or from either
crewstation on the DMS Shutdown sub-page.
Although the TADS is automatically initialized on APU power,
the laser rangefinder/designator (LRFD) requires manual
activation by pressing VAB L6. The FLIR camera may be
independently powered on or off by pressing VAB L5, and
the TADS turret may be stowed by pressing VAB R4.
Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR)
The FLIR camera enables the AH-64 to detect, identify and
engage enemy targets in any lighting conditions. Although
primarily used during night operations, the FLIR is equally FLIR Aperture
capable during daylight hours. The Modernized-TADS
(MTADS) upgrade replaced the legacy FLIR sensor with a
modern FLIR with improved resolution and range.
The TADS FLIR camera includes three optical fields-of-
view (Wide, Medium, and Narrow) with incrementally
increased magnification. A fourth field-of-view (Zoom) is
available that electronically enlarges the Narrow field-of-
view by 50%. The Zoom field-of-view (FOV) does not
provide increased resolution but does facilitate better
aiming precision of the laser rangefinder/designator DTV Aperture LRFD Aperture DVO Aperture
(LRFD) at longer ranges.
 TADS Sensor Turret

Daytime Television (DTV)
The DTV is a monochromatic (black and white) television camera that enables the AH-64 to engage targets at
long-range during daylight hours only. Although the DTV only includes two optical fields-of-view (Wide and
Narrow) and is less versatile than the FLIR camera, the magnification levels of the DTV surpass those of the FLIR,
allowing the DTV to identify and designate targets at a further distance than what is possible with the FLIR. Like
the FLIR, the DTV includes an additional Zoom field-of-view that electronically enlarges the Narrow field-of-view
by 50%.


Laser Rangefinder/Designator (LRFD)
The LRFD uses focused laser energy to precisely measure range to target locations, and employs crew-selectable
pulsed repetition frequencies (PRF) to designate targets for laser-guided munitions, such as the AGM-114 missile.
Laser returns from the TADS LRFD are processed between a minimum range of 500 meters to a maximum range
of 9,999 meters. In addition to providing ranging data for ballistics computations, continuous laser designations
may be used to employ lead-angle compensation when engaging moving targets with the 30mm Area Weapon
System (AWS) or unguided rockets in Cooperative rocket mode.
The LRFD may be employed in range-finding mode by pulling the LRFD trigger on the TEDAC Right Handgrip to
the 1st detent, or in ranging and designation mode by pulling the LRFD trigger to the 2nd detent.
(See the WPN Code and WPN Frequency sub-pages in the Weapon Employment chapter for more information
regarding setting the LRFD laser code.)


Laser Spot Tracker (LST)
The LST may be employed in lieu of the LRFD to detect other laser designations within a tactical environment
when using known PRF codes. Like the LRFD, the specific laser PRF code the LST will scan for is crew-selectable
from the cockpit at any time during the mission, and may be used as an efficient method for handing over target
locations to the AH-64 from ground-based designators or other aircraft, such as the AH-64’s own team members.
(See TADS Targeting Modes for more information regarding LST operation. See the WPN Code and WPN
Frequency sub-pages in the Weapon Employment chapter for more information regarding setting the LST laser
code.)
Sight Stabilization and Slew Rate Damping
The TADS electronics provide automatic sight stabilization to compensate for aircraft angular rates. In addition,
angular slew rates of the TADS turret itself are dampened based on the currently selected optical/electronic field-
of-view to enhance precision targeting. As the Copilot/Gunner (CPG) incrementally steps through each successive
field-of-view from Wide to Zoom, the angular rate gains from Sight Manual Tracker (MAN TRK) inputs are
incrementally reduced to compensate for the higher magnification levels of TADS video.


Target State Estimator (TSE)
Although the Target State Estimator calculations are performed by the AH-64D’s targeting systems and is not
technically part of the TADS itself, the TSE is a key element when the TADS is being used to employ unguided,
ballistic munitions against moving targets on the battlefield.
The TSE utilizes linear velocities and attitude rates from the aircraft EGI’s, TADS turret position and angular slew
rates, and laser range data to calculate and separate true target velocities from the aircraft velocities and rates.
Once the true target velocity is calculated, the TSE can determine the appropriate lead-angle compensation for
the selected weapon system. This automatic lead angle compensation requires the Copilot/Gunner to simply
maintain the TADS line-of-sight on the target and perform a continuous laser designation to accurately employ
the Area Weapon System or provide accurate rocket steering for the Pilot when in Cooperative rocket mode.

 Target State Estimator (TSE) Lead Angle Compensation

When the laser ceases designation, the TSE will enter a “laser memory” mode for 14 seconds. During this period,
the mean rate of change of ranging measurements that existed prior to the termination of laser designation are
dynamically maintained to permit the TSE to continue providing lead angle compensation. All other variables such
as linear velocities and angular rates are utilized by the TSE in real-time to calculate the true target velocity.
After the 14 seconds has elapsed, the laser range value will become static until the LRFD is fired again or a
different range source is utilized. Any time a dynamic laser range is not available, whether the 1 st detent of the
LRFD trigger is used or 14 seconds has elapsed since the 2nd detent of the LRFD trigger was used, or if any other
range source is utilized, TSE lead angle compensation will be unavailable. However, regardless of whether the
TSE is providing lead angle compensation or not, ballistic compensation will always be provided for factors such
as range to target and aircraft movement when the TADS is being used as the selected sight.
TADS WEAPON SYMBOLOGY
If the Copilot/Gunner’s selected sight is TADS, TADS sensor video is displayed on the CPG’s HDU and TDU,

TADS TARGETING MODES
The TADS may be utilized with several targeting modes to assist the Copilot/Gunner (CPG) in performing targeting
operations against enemy target locations. Targeting modes consist of Linear Motion Compensation (LMC), Image
Auto-Track (IAT), and Laser Spot Track (LST). These targeting modes reduce the workload of the CPG when
using the TADS but do not directly affect the operation of any weapon system on the aircraft.


Linear Motion Compensation (LMC)
Linear Motion Compensation provides additional stabilization of the TADS to compensate for linear movement of
the aircraft or the target.
When LMC is disabled, the slew rates of the TADS turret are based on raw
input magnitudes received from the force-sensing Sight Manual Tracker
(MAN TRK, also called the “thumb force controller”) on the TEDAC Right
Handgrip. When no force is applied to the Sight Manual Tracker, the
angular slew rates of the TADS turret are dampened in azimuth and
elevation. When thumb force is applied, the TADS turret slew rate will
increase as the force magnitude increases and will correspondingly
decrease as force magnitude decreases.
When LMC is enabled, indicated by the presence of the LMC Indicator
around the TADS Line-Of-Sight Reticle, angular slew rates of the TADS
turret are maintained until modified by CPG input or alternate steering LMC Indicator
commands by the TADS electronics themselves. When no force is applied
to the Sight Manual Tracker, the angular slew rates of the TADS turret are maintained. When thumb force is
applied, the TADS turret slew rate will increase at a rate corresponding to the force magnitude applied to the
Sight Manual Tracker.
LMC automatically converts angular rates based on the current range value utilized by the TADS to compensate
for motion parallax. As the range increases or decreases, the LMC will automatically adjust the TADS slew rate
to maintain the calculated angular velocity at the corresponding range. As targets that are closer in range will
have a higher angular rate compared to targets further away, the LMC will increase the TADS slew rate to
compensate. In addition, angular rate gains from Sight Manual Tracker input force magnitudes will accordingly
scale based on the current range value.

Image Auto-Track (IAT)
IAT is an automatic tracking mode that allows the TADS to automatically maintain the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) Reticle
on battlefield targets. Unlike the previous generation of TADS in which the IAT tracking logic relied purely on
object contrast amongst its background, the digital tracking logic within the M-TADS uses the scene content
within the video source to lock onto distinct features.
Additionally, the digital IAT will automatically enter an inertial track and “coast” in the event weapons fire, smoke,
obscurance, or explosions on the battlefield interfere with its ability to maintain track. This inertial track logic
prevents the M-TADS from locking on to an unintended target or nearby object when a break lock occurs, which
was characteristic of previous versions of TADS that functioned purely on contrast tracking.
When the IAT/OFS switch on the TEDAC Left Handgrip is momentarily set to the IAT position, an track is initiated
on the target underneath the TADS LOS Reticle. When this occurs, a set of four brackets, called the Primary Track
Gates, are placed around the tracked object, a Track Number is placed below the tracking gates, and the total
number of tracks is updated in the top right corner of the TADS symbology.

 from an offset position.
3. Track Number. Indicates the assigned track number for the primary tracked target.
4. Total Number of Tracks. Indicates the total number of tracked targets, out of a maximum of 3. (See
 Multi-Target Tracker for more information.)
Once a new primary track is established, the TADS will automatically maintain the LOS Reticle over the IAT Aim
Point until a slew is commanded. If the Copilot/Gunner (CPG) inputs a slew using the Sight Manual Tracker, the
TADS LOS is released from automatic slewing and may be manually slewed until the TADS is commanded to
return to the primary track using the OFS position of the IAT/OFS switch.
The specific functionality of the IAT/OFS switch will vary depending on whether the TADS
 S Short press (<0.5 sec)
LOS Reticle is within the boundaries of the Primary Track Gates, signified by the gates
themselves becoming bolded. Additionally, the commanded function when set to the L Long press (>0.5 sec)
OFS position is dependent on the duration of the press.
When the LOS Reticle is within the boundaries of the Primary Track Gates, the following commands apply:
• IAT position will update the Aim

• OFS position for greater than 0.5 seconds will delete all tracks.
Additional details regarding the Image Auto-Track are shown below.
• Target tracking is only performed in one TADS sensor at a time. If a track is established while the selected
 TADS sensor is set to FLIR, the track will continue to be tracked within the FLIR camera, even if the CPG
 selects DTV using the Sensor Select switch on the TEDAC Left Handgrip, and vice versa.
• Once a primary track has been established, the TADS turret may only be slewed to the extent that the
 primary track can be maintained within the current optical field-of-view of the TADS sensor within which the
 automatic tracking is being performed.
• Target tracking is limited to objects that occupy between 0.75% to 50% of the tracking sensor’s field-of-
 view. If the object being tracked is too small or too large within the current optical field-of-view, a track
 cannot be established, and an existing track will switch to inertial tracking.
Due to the combination of these factors, FLIR is better suited for maintaining multiple tracks due to its wider
field-of-view, especially for tracks that are widely spaced on the battlefield, or for retaining the primary track
within the field-of-view when a significant offset slew is desired. However, the DTV is better suited for maintaining
tracks at longer range due to its higher magnification levels.
Multi-Target Tracker (MTT)
The M-TADS digital tracker is capable of maintaining an image auto-track on up to three separate targets, a
single primary track and two secondary tracks. When being used in this manner, the tracking and slew logic and
the IAT/OFS switch functions remain the same but are only referenced to primary track.

Any time a new track is established, the new track is designated as the primary track, and the existing primary
track is demoted to a secondary track. An existing secondary track may be promoted back to primary track at
any time using one of two methods.
• Manually slew the LOS Reticle over the desired track and momentarily press the IAT/OFS switch to the IAT
 position. This will promote the secondary track under the LOS Reticle to primary track, update the Aim Point
 of the new primary track, and automatic slewing will be performed until another secondary track is promoted
 or the Copilot/Gunner inputs a slew using the Sight Manual Tracker. (See TEDAC Left Handgrip for more
 information.)
• Set the MTT Promote switch to the + or – positions to promote the secondary tracks to primary track in a
 cyclic pattern. When a secondary track is promoted to the primary track using the MTT Promote switch,
 the TADS LOS Reticle will be slewed to the Aim Point of the new primary track and automatic slewing will
 be performed until another secondary track is promoted or the Copilot/Gunner inputs a slew using the
 Sight Manual Tracker. (See TEDAC Right Handgrip for more information.)
Inertial Tracking
In the event weapons fire, smoke, obscurance, or explosions on the battlefield interfere with the automatic
tracking of the primary or secondary tracks, the track will enter an inertial tracking sub-mode. In this mode, the
track will “coast” along its previous path for a short period before the track is dropped altogether. If the track is
reacquired while in inertial track, automatic tracking will resume.

• If the primary track has switched to inertial tracking, the Primary
 Track Gates will be replaced by the Inertial Gates. After 5 seconds
 of inertial tracking, the Inertial Gates will be replaced by the Low
 Confidence Gates.
• If a secondary track has switched to inertial tracking, the
 Secondary Track Flag will become dashed to indicate inertial
 tracking. After 5 seconds of inertial tracking, the Secondary Track
 Flag will become dotted to indicate low confidence.
• If the track is not reacquired within 10 seconds of inertial
 tracking, the track will be dropped and “TRK # DROP” will be
 displayed in the Weapon Inhibit Status field, where # is the Inertial Track Flag
 number of the track that has been dropped.
If the primary or secondary tracks are forced outside the TADS field-
of-view, the Primary Track Gates and/or Secondary Track Flags are
replaced by bars along the edge of the video to indicate the location of
the tracks relative to the TADS field-of-view.

Laser Spot Track (LST)
The LST may be configured to search for and track pulsed laser designations using standard PRF codes
independently of the ownship’s LRFD code. The Laser Spot Tracker is enabled using the LT switch on the TEDAC
Right Handgrip. When set to the A position, the LST is enabled and set to automatic mode. When set to the M
position, the LST is enabled and set to manual mode. When set to the O position, the LST is disabled.
NOTE: The TADS laser rangefinder/designator (LRFD) cannot be fired while the LST is enabled.
When the LST is employed, the Multi-Target Tracker will continue to perform automatic tracking of the primary
and secondary tracks if the respective tracks remain within the optical field-of-view of the TADS sensor. However,
if the tracks are forced outside the TADS field-of-view while LST operations are being performed, the tracks will
enter inertial track, and may eventually be dropped.


Automatic Mode
When the LST is enabled in the automatic mode, the TADS will enter a continuous, 4-bar azimuth/elevation scan
pattern until a laser designation matching the PRF code assigned to the LST is detected, or the LST is disabled.
Once a matching laser designation is detected, the TADS will slew to and track the laser designation. If the laser
designation is lost, the TADS will resume the 4-bar scan.
NOTE: It is advisable that the LST be disabled prior to instructing the designating platform to cease lasing. If the
laser designation is lost before the LST is disabled, the TADS turret will resume the 4-bar scan pattern.
In addition, when slaving the TADS to an acquisition source, the LST should be disabled prior to disabling the
SLAVE function to ensure the TADS is not inadvertently slewed from the intended location by the 4-bar scan in
automatic mode, or if a matching laser designation is detected in automatic or manual mode.

Manual Mode
When the LST is enabled in the manual mode, the Copilot/Gunner retains manual slew control of the TADS turret
until a laser designation matching the PRF code assigned to the LST is detected. Once a matching laser
designation is detected, the TADS will slew to and track the laser designation. If the laser designation is lost,
manual slew control of the TADS turret is restored.
TADS ACQUISITION AND RANGING
In similar fashion to using the HMD as the selected sight, detecting, acquiring, and engaging targets with the
TADS is fairly straightforward, in that the TADS simply needs to be directed toward and stabilized on the target
to generate an appropriate weapon solution. TADS targeting modes such as LMC and IAT assist the
Copilot/Gunner (CPG) in target tracking, and the LST assists the CPG in acquiring an offboard laser designation,
but autonomously and efficiently acquiring targets using the TADS and performing an accurate ranging of the
target location is critical in achieving a successful target engagement.
Generally speaking, TADS sensors and fields-of-view (FOV) are best used in Zoom
the following manner. FOV

• Initial detection of targets on the battlefield: FLIR Wide/Medium FOV. Narrow
 FOV
• Individual target acquisition: FLIR Wide/Medium FOV or DTV Wide FOV.
• Target identification: FLIR Narrow FOV or DTV Narrow FOV.
• Target tracking: FLIR Narrow/Zoom FOV; DTV Narrow/Zoom FOV.
As with most tactical situations, many variables may determine the ideal sensor Medium FOV
and field-of-view. Factors such as target size, range to target, time of day, and
movement of the aircraft or target will play significant roles in determining
which sensor or field-of-view should be. For example, a company of tanks will
be much easier to detect and acquire in Wide FOV, whereas a squad of infantry
at the same range may not be detected until Narrow FOV is utilized. In addition, Wide FOV
the reduced slew rates and narrow fields-of-view of Narrow or Zoom FOV levels
may make them unsuitable for engaging targets at close range, depending on
whether the intended targets (or the aircraft) are moving at a high angular
velocity.
If a target is lost or inadvertently exits the TADS field-of-view, it is normally
wise to “back out” to the previous field-of-view to re-acquire the target within
the center of the TADS video, stabilize the TADS movement as necessary, and
then “step in” to the next field-of-view to resume tracking as desired.
It is important to note that the Zoom FOV is simply an electronic magnification
of the video received from the TADS sensors and will not provide an increase
in target resolution or detail. However, the larger video image may aid in
precision tracking against long-range targets in which precise placement of the
TADS laser beam is critical in accurate ranging or designation of the target.


Acquisition Sources
The use of acquisition sources can reduce the time necessary to bring the TADS onto an intended target. When
a target is detected using another sensor onboard the aircraft (to include visual detection by either crewmember),
setting that sensor as the acquisition source and enabling the SLAVE function increases the efficiency of target
acquisition within the TADS.
Acquisition sources also reduce the amount of verbal communications and coordination of sensors that must
occur between the crewmembers, which also increases combat efficiency. By replacing the verbal description of
a target (or threat) using a verbose “description, direction, distance” with a concise “sight to source” command,
target handovers between crewstations may become near instantaneous with a proficient aircrew. In addition,
slaving the selected sight directly to the location of the acquisition source reduces the effects of inaccurate range
estimations and removes the need for verbal descriptions of the intended target, or visual reference points to aid
in locating the correct target amongst many.
An example of an inefficient target handover from the Pilot’s HMD to the CPG’s TADS is shown below:
“Gunner, target tank at 11 o’clock, approximately 4 kilometers, dug-in along the north-south running treeline.”
The CPG must manually slew the TADS to the approximate direction, visually identify the correct treeline along
that general direction (assuming the Pilot’s range estimate was accurate) and then locate the correct tank in that
vicinity.
Examples of efficient target handovers utilizing acquisition sources are shown below:
“Gunner, target, Pilot helmet sight. Tank in the treeline.”
“Gunner, target, FCR. Tracked vehicle, range 4.6.”
In either case, the CPG simply selects the announced source of target information as the acquisition source and
enables SLAVE, slewing the TADS line-of-sight directly to the location of the intended target, removing most of
any targeting ambiguity that exists.
Acquisition sources that will command the TADS to a specific azimuth and elevation relative to the aircraft nose
are listed below.
• PHS. Pilot Helmet Sight; commands the TADS to the line-of-sight of the Pilot’s helmet. May be used to direct
 the TADS to the location designated by the Pilot’s HMD LOS Reticle.
• GHS. Gunner Helmet Sight; commands the TADS to the line-of-sight of the Copilot/Gunner’s helmet. May
 be used to direct the TADS to the location designated by his/her own HMD LOS Reticle.
• SKR. Seeker; commands the TADS to the line-of-sight of the next-to-shoot AGM-114 missile seeker. May
 be used to direct the TADS to the target location that is currently being tracked by the next-to-shoot AGM-
 114 missile, possibly to confirm target identification prior to weapons release.
• FXD. Fixed forward; commands the TADS to align with the Armament Datum Line (ADL) at 0° in azimuth
 and -4.9° in elevation.
Acquisition sources that will command the TADS to a 3-dimensional location relative to the ownship position are
listed below.
• FCR. Fire Control Radar; commands the TADS to the location of the next-to-shoot target designated on the
 FCR page. May be used to direct the TADS to the location of the designated target to perform visual
 identification prior to weapons release, or to engage the designated target while using TADS as the sight.
• W##, H##, C##, T##. Waypoint, Hazard, Control Measure, or Target/Threat point; commands the TADS
 to the coordinates of the selected point within the navigation database. May be used to direct the TADS to
 a pre-planned, stored, or transmitted location for reconnaissance, visual identification, weapons
 engagement, or re-acquisition if line-of-sight was lost.
• TRN. Terrain point; commands the TADS to the coordinates of the selected terrain point within the
 navigation database. May be used to direct the TADS to a cursor-selected location on the TSD that is not
 associated with an existing Waypoint, Hazard, Control Measure, or Target/Threat point for reconnaissance,
 visual identification, or weapons engagement.
Range Sources
Once a target has been successfully acquired and is being tracked within the TADS field-of-view, the next and
perhaps most critical step in ensuring a successful weapon engagement is determining an accurate range to the
intended target. As the TADS line-of-sight can only determine a target’s relative azimuth and elevation with
respect to the aircraft’s attitude, measuring the range to the target along the TADS line-of-sight provides the
third dimension needed to determine the target’s 3-dimensional position relative to the ownship.
Among the three sights (HMD, TADS, and FCR) that may be employed by the AH-64D aircrew for targeting, the
TADS facilitates the most options when determining what method of ranging may be employed. When a method
of ranging is employed, this is called a “range source”, and is displayed within the High Action Display in both
Flight Symbology and Weapon Symbology.
The range sources that are available to the Copilot/Gunner (CPG) when using the TADS as the selected sight are
shown below, from the most accurate to the least accurate.
• Laser range. Laser range is automatically entered as the range source any time the CPG fires the TADS
 LRFD to measure the slant range between the ownship and the target using reflected laser energy.
• Navigation range. Navigation range is automatically entered as the range source any time the TADS is
 slaved to a Waypoint, Hazard, Control Measure, Target/Threat, or a Terrain point. The slant range between
 the ownship and the corresponding point’s navigational coordinates are calculated and is subject to the
 position confidence of the aircraft.
• Automatic range. Automatic range is selected from the WPN page by pressing MANRNG> (VAB B6) and
 entering “A” on the Keyboard Unit (KU) in place of a numerical value. Auto-range is determined by the radar
 altitude of the aircraft over the ground and the elevation “look-down” angle of the TADS turret.
• Manual range. Manual range is selected from the WPN page by pressing MANRNG> (VAB B6) and entering
 a numeric value on the Keyboard Unit.
• Default range. Default range is selected upon initial aircraft power-on, or any time the crewmember’s
 current range source is no longer valid.
When manually tracking a target while utilizing Linear Motion Compensation (LMC), it is best to use a dynamic
range source to minimize “range jumps”, which increases the CPG’s workload in maintaining the TADS crosshairs
on the intended target. As LMC will automatically convert TADS angular rates based on the current range value
to compensate for motion parallax, the greater the difference between the previous range value and the next will
cause a greater jump in TADS slew rates.
Dynamic range sources include a laser range when a continuous laser designation is employed (2nd detent of the
laser trigger), a navigation range to a point stored in the vicinity of the target, or an automatic range when
operating over relatively flat terrain. As these range sources may not always be practical depending on the specific
tactical situation or the terrain over which the aircrew is operating, the range source that is best suited for the
situation should be chosen to reduce the CPG workload during targeting operations.
Static range sources include a laser range when a single range-finding pulse is employed (1st detent of the laser
trigger), a manual range entered on the WPN page, or the default range which is displayed upon initial power-
up of the aircraft or if the current range source is rendered invalid. Such range sources are not dynamic and
represent fixed points in space to which weapon solutions are calculated. As such, the TADS elevation relative to
the target will need to be manually adjusted to account for rounds that impact prior to or beyond the target (also
referred to as landing “short” or “long”).
Laser Range
The TADS laser rangefinder/designator (LRFD) provides the most precise range source available when using the
TADS as the selected sight. Based on the TADS line-of-sight (LOS) and the slant range measured by the LRFD, a
weapon solution is generated based on the selected weapon system (gun or rockets) and, in the specific case of
the rockets, the selected warhead type.
If the aircraft and/or the target is moving, a continuous laser designation using the 2nd detent of the laser trigger
should be employed. This will continuously update the precise slant range to the target and will also engage the
Target State Estimator in calculating lead angle compensation against targets that are moving across the
battlefield.

 Laser Range (2nd detent designation)

It is important to note that lasing accuracy is more critical when employed by attack helicopters due to the shallow
targeting angles compared to fixed-wing strike aircraft. Laser designations should be focused precisely onto the
target to prevent the laser beam from impacting the ground prior to the target (laser underspill) or beyond the
target (laser overspill). Due to the greater difference in slant range calculations when such events occur, weapons
accuracy is significantly affected when lasing at shallow angles.




 Shallow angle overspill results Steep angle overspill results
 in increased range error in reduced range error




 Laser overspill during target designation
When the LRFD is fired using the 1st detent of the laser trigger, or 14 seconds has elapsed since the LRFD stopped
firing using the 2nd detent of the laser trigger, the laser range will become “stale”, and will remain at a fixed range
value. When this occurs, the weapon solution will continue to update based on the TADS line-of-sight (LOS), but
the range value will be to a fixed point in space along the LOS and may not represent the true slant range to the
target.




 TADS LOS

 azimuth and elevation space along TADS LOS short of the target




 Laser Range (stale range)

If the selected weapon is employed while using a stale laser range, the weapons will likely impact prior to or
beyond the target (also referred to as landing “short” or “long”). If necessary, manual aiming adjustments may
be made by adjusting the TADS LOS higher above the target to correct for rounds landing short, or adjusting the
TADS LOS further below the target to correct for rounds landing long.
Navigation Range
Navigation range is calculated by simply measuring the slant range between the ownship position and the
coordinates of a point stored within the navigational database. Although a Nav range is more accurate than using
Auto-ranging or Man-ranging, in that it is dynamically updated with aircraft movement and does not rely on flat
terrain as is the case with Automatic range, Nav range is not as accurate as using a laser range.
Any time the SLAVE button is pressed when the Copilot/Gunner’s acquisition source is set to a Waypoint, Hazard,
Control Measure, Target/Threat, or Terrain point, the slant range to the corresponding point is entered as a Nav
range. This may be particularly useful when using “indirect fire” techniques, such as firing unguided rockets from
behind cover against a set of coordinates or when employing laser-guided Hellfire missiles in a “Remote Fire”
engagement method. However, when employing weapons against targets within the TADS line-of-sight, a
Navigation range is only preferred if the intended target is within close proximity to the coordinates of the point
being referenced by the Nav range, or if employing area effect weapons against the general area surrounding
the point.
In the figure below, the intended target is at a range to the ownship that is substantially closer than the point
being referenced (T01) for the Nav range. In such a situation, rockets would impact beyond the target due to
the equivalent slant range being applied along the TADS line-of-sight, placing the weapon solution beyond the
target and below the surface plane. The TADS LOS Reticle would need to be displaced below the target within
the TADS field-of-view to adjust the weapon solution in such a manner so that the weapon trajectory would
intersect with the target location.

 Navigation Range (ACQ set to T01)

Aside from long-range, indirect fire techniques, the most common use cases for employing a Nav range are when
the CPG desires a smooth transition to a laser range source when firing the LRFD while LMC is enabled, or when
the Pilot is employing unguided rockets with variable time delay fuzes independently of the CPG. Rocket types
such as the M255A1 or M261 are dependent on an accurate range to target for their warheads to be effective.
Unless fired in Cooperative mode with the CPG’s TADS supplying an accurate laser range, the most accurate
range source that can be used by the Pilot to achieve the desired warhead effects is a Nav range.
Automatic Range
Automatic range is calculated using trigonometric ratios of right triangles, where the TADS look-down angle
relative to the vertical axis between the aircraft and the surface below it is the acute angle; and the altitude
above ground level (as measured by the radar altimeter) is the adjacent edge of the right triangle.
Using these two variables, along with an assumption the target is at an elevation equal to the that of the surface
directly below the aircraft along a lateral axis that represents the opposite edge of the right triangle, the
hypotenuse is calculated to determine the slant range to target. This calculation is performed continuously based
on the TADS turret elevation and the radar altitude of the aircraft.

 Automatic Range (flat terrain)

As the TADS line-of-sight (LOS) approaches the horizon and the look-down angles become quite shallow, the
Auto-range calculations will become increasingly less precise due to the trigonometric ratios becoming quite large
which is exacerbated if the aircraft is operating at very low altitudes over the surface.




 TADS line-of-sight just below the TADS line-of-sight adjusted slightly

Automatic range relies upon a functioning radar altimeter and will only be usable when the aircraft’s altitude
above ground level (AGL) is less than 1,428 feet (the maximum altitude that is capable of being measured by the
radar altimeter).
It is important to note that the accuracy of Automatic range is predicated on the assumption that the target is at
the same elevation as the surface directly below the aircraft. As this may not always be the case, using Auto-
range for weapon engagements should only be performed in areas with minimal terrain relief, such as open
plains, non-mountainous deserts, large plateaus, or basins. Auto-range should not be used when operating over
mountains, rolling hills, or complex urban areas.

In situations where the terrain directly below the aircraft is at a significantly higher elevation than that of the
intended target, it should be expected that any weapon solution generated using Auto-range will result in
unguided, ballistic munitions such as rockets or gun rounds landing short of the target location. Likewise, in
situations where the terrain directly below the aircraft is at a significantly lower elevation than that of the intended
target, it should be expected that rockets or gun rounds will land long beyond the target location.
Manual/Default Range
Manual range is the most inaccurate form of ranging when using the TADS. When a manual range value is
entered, the weapon solution will continue to update based on the TADS line-of-sight (LOS), but the range value
will be to a fixed point in space along the LOS at the range entered on the WPN page.

 Manual/Default Range

A Man-range is analogous to zeroing a rifle at a specific distance, and manually compensating for bullet drop by
manually elevating the weapon sight higher or lower depending on the estimated range to the target relative to
the range to which the rifle was zeroed.
• If the intended target is estimated to be at a range greater than the manual range value, the TADS LOS
 Reticle must be aimed above the target to compensate for the additional bullet (or rocket) drop.
• If the intended target is estimated to be at a range less than the manual range value, the TADS LOS Reticle
